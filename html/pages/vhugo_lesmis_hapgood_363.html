			<div class="cts_corpus"><div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.1.19.head</span><span class="cts_passage">CHAPTER XIX—JEAN VALJEAN TAKES HIS REVENGE </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.1.19.1</span><span class="cts_passage">When Jean Valjean was left alone with Javert, he untied the rope which fastened the prisoner across the middle of the body, and the knot of which was under the table. After this he made him a sign to rise. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.1.19.2</span><span class="cts_passage">Javert obeyed with that indefinable smile in which the supremacy of enchained authority is condensed. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.1.19.3</span><span class="cts_passage">Jean Valjean took Javert by the martingale, as one would take a beast of burden by the breast-band, and, dragging the latter after him, emerged from the wine-shop slowly, because Javert, with his impeded limbs, could take only very short steps. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.1.19.4</span><span class="cts_passage">Jean Valjean had the pistol in his hand. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.1.19.5</span><span class="cts_passage">In this manner they crossed the inner trapezium of the barricade. The insurgents, all intent on the attack, which was imminent, had their backs turned to these two. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.1.19.6</span><span class="cts_passage">Marius alone, stationed on one side, at the extreme left of the barricade, saw them pass. This group of victim and executioner was illuminated by the sepulchral light which he bore in his own soul. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.1.19.7</span><span class="cts_passage">Jean Valjean with some difficulty, but without relaxing his hold for a single instant, made Javert, pinioned as he was, scale the little entrenchment in the Mondétour lane. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.1.19.8</span><span class="cts_passage">When they had crossed this barrier, they found themselves alone in the lane. No one saw them. Among the heap they could distinguish a livid face, streaming hair, a pierced hand and the half nude breast of a woman. It was Éponine. The corner of the houses hid them from the insurgents. The corpses carried away from the barricade formed a terrible pile a few paces distant. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.1.19.9</span><span class="cts_passage">Javert gazed askance at this body, and, profoundly calm, said in a low tone: </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.1.19.10</span><span class="cts_passage">“It strikes me that I know that girl.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.1.19.11</span><span class="cts_passage">Then he turned to Jean Valjean. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.1.19.12</span><span class="cts_passage">Jean Valjean thrust the pistol under his arm and fixed on Javert a look which it required no words to interpret: “Javert, it is I.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.1.19.13</span><span class="cts_passage">Javert replied: </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.1.19.14</span><span class="cts_passage">“Take your revenge.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.1.19.15</span><span class="cts_passage">Jean Valjean drew from his pocket a knife, and opened it. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.1.19.16</span><span class="cts_passage">“A clasp-knife!” exclaimed Javert, “you are right. That suits you better.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.1.19.17</span><span class="cts_passage">Jean Valjean cut the martingale which Javert had about his neck, then he cut the cords on his wrists, then, stooping down, he cut the cord on his feet; and, straightening himself up, he said to him: </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.1.19.18</span><span class="cts_passage">“You are free.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.1.19.19</span><span class="cts_passage">Javert was not easily astonished. Still, master of himself though he was, he could not repress a start. He remained open-mouthed and motionless. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.1.19.20</span><span class="cts_passage">Jean Valjean continued: </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.1.19.21</span><span class="cts_passage">“I do not think that I shall escape from this place. But if, by chance, I do, I live, under the name of Fauchelevent, in the Rue de l’Homme Armé, No. 7.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.1.19.22</span><span class="cts_passage">Javert snarled like a tiger, which made him half open one corner of his mouth, and he muttered between his teeth: </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.1.19.23</span><span class="cts_passage">“Have a care.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.1.19.24</span><span class="cts_passage">“Go,” said Jean Valjean. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.1.19.25</span><span class="cts_passage">Javert began again: </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.1.19.26</span><span class="cts_passage">“Thou saidst Fauchelevent, Rue de l’Homme Armé?” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.1.19.27</span><span class="cts_passage">“Number 7.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.1.19.28</span><span class="cts_passage">Javert repeated in a low voice:—“Number 7.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.1.19.29</span><span class="cts_passage">He buttoned up his coat once more, resumed the military stiffness between his shoulders, made a half turn, folded his arms and, supporting his chin on one of his hands, he set out in the direction of the Halles. Jean Valjean followed him with his eyes: </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.1.19.30</span><span class="cts_passage">A few minutes later, Javert turned round and shouted to Jean Valjean: </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.1.19.31</span><span class="cts_passage">“You annoy me. Kill me, rather.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.1.19.32</span><span class="cts_passage">Javert himself did not notice that he no longer addressed Jean Valjean as “thou.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.1.19.33</span><span class="cts_passage">“Be off with you,” said Jean Valjean. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.1.19.34</span><span class="cts_passage">Javert retreated slowly. A moment later he turned the corner of the Rue des Prêcheurs. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.1.19.35</span><span class="cts_passage">When Javert had disappeared, Jean Valjean fired his pistol in the air. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.1.19.36</span><span class="cts_passage">Then he returned to the barricade and said: </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.1.19.37</span><span class="cts_passage">“It is done.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.1.19.38</span><span class="cts_passage">In the meanwhile, this is what had taken place. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.1.19.39</span><span class="cts_passage">Marius, more intent on the outside than on the interior, had not, up to that time, taken a good look at the pinioned spy in the dark background of the tap-room. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.1.19.40</span><span class="cts_passage">When he beheld him in broad daylight, striding over the barricade in order to proceed to his death, he recognized him. Something suddenly recurred to his mind. He recalled the inspector of the Rue de Pontoise, and the two pistols which the latter had handed to him and which he, Marius, had used in this very barricade, and not only did he recall his face, but his name as well. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.1.19.41</span><span class="cts_passage">This recollection was misty and troubled, however, like all his ideas. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.1.19.42</span><span class="cts_passage">It was not an affirmation that he made, but a question which he put to himself: </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.1.19.43</span><span class="cts_passage">“Is not that the inspector of police who told me that his name was Javert?” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.1.19.44</span><span class="cts_passage">Perhaps there was still time to intervene in behalf of that man. But, in the first place, he must know whether this was Javert. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.1.19.45</span><span class="cts_passage">Marius called to Enjolras, who had just stationed himself at the other extremity of the barricade: </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.1.19.46</span><span class="cts_passage">“Enjolras!” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.1.19.47</span><span class="cts_passage">“What?” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.1.19.48</span><span class="cts_passage">“What is the name of yonder man?” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.1.19.49</span><span class="cts_passage">“What man?” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.1.19.50</span><span class="cts_passage">“The police agent. Do you know his name?” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.1.19.51</span><span class="cts_passage">“Of course. He told us.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.1.19.52</span><span class="cts_passage">“What is it?” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.1.19.53</span><span class="cts_passage">“Javert.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.1.19.54</span><span class="cts_passage">Marius sprang to his feet. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.1.19.55</span><span class="cts_passage">At that moment, they heard the report of the pistol. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.1.19.56</span><span class="cts_passage">Jean Valjean reappeared and cried: “It is done.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.1.19.57</span><span class="cts_passage">A gloomy chill traversed Marius’ heart. </span></div></div>
