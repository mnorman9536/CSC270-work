<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.18.3</span><span class="cts_passage">Then he began to pace up and down the room, listened at the corridor, walked on again, then listened once more. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.18.4</span><span class="cts_passage">“Provided only that he comes!” he muttered, then he returned to his chair. </span></div>

<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.18.11</span><span class="cts_passage">He laid four louis on the table. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.18.12</span><span class="cts_passage">“Monsieur Fabantou,” said he, “this is for your rent and your most pressing necessities. We will attend to the rest hereafter.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.18.13</span><span class="cts_passage">“May God requite it to you, my generous benefactor!” said Jondrette. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.18.14</span><span class="cts_passage">And rapidly approaching his wife:— </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.18.15</span><span class="cts_passage">“Dismiss the carriage!” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.18.16</span><span class="cts_passage">She slipped out while her husband was lavishing salutes and offering M. Leblanc a chair. An instant later she returned and whispered in his ear:— </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.18.17</span><span class="cts_passage">“‘Tis done.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.18.18</span><span class="cts_passage">The snow, which had not ceased falling since the morning, was so deep that the arrival of the fiacre had not been audible, and they did not now hear its departure. </span></div>

<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.18.20</span><span class="cts_passage">Jondrette had taken possession of the other chair, facing M. Leblanc. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.18.21</span><span class="cts_passage">Now, in order to form an idea of the scene which is to follow, let the reader picture to himself in his own mind, a cold night, the solitudes of the Salpêtrière covered with snow and white as winding-sheets in the moonlight, the taper-like lights of the street lanterns which shone redly here and there along those tragic boulevards, and the long rows of black elms, not a passer-by for perhaps a quarter of a league around, the Gorbeau hovel, at its highest pitch of silence, of horror, and of darkness; in that building, in the midst of those solitudes, in the midst of that darkness, the vast Jondrette garret lighted by a single candle, and in that den two men seated at a table, M. Leblanc tranquil, Jondrette smiling and alarming, the Jondrette woman, the female wolf, in one corner, and, behind the partition, Marius, invisible, erect, not losing a word, not missing a single movement, his eye on the watch, and pistol in hand. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.18.22</span><span class="cts_passage">However, Marius experienced only an emotion of horror, but no fear. He clasped the stock of the pistol firmly and felt reassured. “I shall be able to stop that wretch whenever I please,” he thought. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.18.23</span><span class="cts_passage">He felt that the police were there somewhere in ambuscade, waiting for the signal agreed upon and ready to stretch out their arm. </span></div>
