<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.11.1</span><span class="cts_passage">Marius ascended the stairs of the hovel with slow steps; at the moment when he was about to re-enter his cell, he caught sight of the elder Jondrette girl following him through the corridor. The very sight of this girl was odious to him; it was she who had his five francs, it was too late to demand them back, the cab was no longer there, the fiacre was far away. Moreover, she would not have given them back. As for questioning her about the residence of the persons who had just been there, that was useless; it was evident that she did not know, since the letter signed Fabantou had been addressed “to the benevolent gentleman of the church of Saint-Jacques-du-Haut-Pas.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.11.2</span><span class="cts_passage">Marius entered his room and pushed the door to after him. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.11.3</span><span class="cts_passage">It did not close; he turned round and beheld a hand which held the door half open. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.11.4</span><span class="cts_passage">“What is it?” he asked, “who is there?” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.11.5</span><span class="cts_passage">It was the Jondrette girl. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.11.6</span><span class="cts_passage">“Is it you?” resumed Marius almost harshly, “still you! What do you want with me?” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.11.7</span><span class="cts_passage">She appeared to be thoughtful and did not look at him. She no longer had the air of assurance which had characterized her that morning. She did not enter, but held back in the darkness of the corridor, where Marius could see her through the half-open door. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.11.8</span><span class="cts_passage">“Come now, will you answer?” cried Marius. “What do you want with me?” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.11.9</span><span class="cts_passage">She raised her dull eyes, in which a sort of gleam seemed to flicker vaguely, and said:— </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.11.10</span><span class="cts_passage">“Monsieur Marius, you look sad. What is the matter with you?” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.11.11</span><span class="cts_passage">“With me!” said Marius. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.11.12</span><span class="cts_passage">“Yes, you.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.11.13</span><span class="cts_passage">“There is nothing the matter with me.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.11.14</span><span class="cts_passage">“Yes, there is!” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.11.15</span><span class="cts_passage">“No.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.11.16</span><span class="cts_passage">“I tell you there is!” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.11.17</span><span class="cts_passage">“Let me alone!” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.11.18</span><span class="cts_passage">Marius gave the door another push, but she retained her hold on it. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.11.19</span><span class="cts_passage">“Stop,” said she, “you are in the wrong. Although you are not rich, you were kind this morning. Be so again now. You gave me something to eat, now tell me what ails you. You are grieved, that is plain. I do not want you to be grieved. What can be done for it? Can I be of any service? Employ me. I do not ask for your secrets, you need not tell them to me, but I may be of use, nevertheless. I may be able to help you, since I help my father. When it is necessary to carry letters, to go to houses, to inquire from door to door, to find out an address, to follow any one, I am of service. Well, you may assuredly tell me what is the matter with you, and I will go and speak to the persons; sometimes it is enough if some one speaks to the persons, that suffices to let them understand matters, and everything comes right. Make use of me.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.11.20</span><span class="cts_passage">An idea flashed across Marius’ mind. What branch does one disdain when one feels that one is falling? </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.11.21</span><span class="cts_passage">He drew near to the Jondrette girl. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.11.22</span><span class="cts_passage">“Listen—” he said to her. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.11.23</span><span class="cts_passage">She interrupted him with a gleam of joy in her eyes. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.11.24</span><span class="cts_passage">“Oh yes, do call me _thou!_ I like that better.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.11.25</span><span class="cts_passage">“Well,” he resumed, “thou hast brought hither that old gentleman and his daughter!” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.11.26</span><span class="cts_passage">“Yes.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.11.27</span><span class="cts_passage">“Dost thou know their address?” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.11.28</span><span class="cts_passage">“No.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.11.29</span><span class="cts_passage">“Find it for me.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.11.30</span><span class="cts_passage">The Jondrette’s dull eyes had grown joyous, and they now became gloomy. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.11.31</span><span class="cts_passage">“Is that what you want?” she demanded. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.11.32</span><span class="cts_passage">“Yes.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.11.33</span><span class="cts_passage">“Do you know them?” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.11.34</span><span class="cts_passage">“No.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.11.35</span><span class="cts_passage">“That is to say,” she resumed quickly, “you do not know her, but you wish to know her.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.11.36</span><span class="cts_passage">This _them_ which had turned into _her_ had something indescribably significant and bitter about it. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.11.37</span><span class="cts_passage">“Well, can you do it?” said Marius. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.11.38</span><span class="cts_passage">“You shall have the beautiful lady’s address.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.11.39</span><span class="cts_passage">There was still a shade in the words “the beautiful lady” which troubled Marius. He resumed:— </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.11.40</span><span class="cts_passage">“Never mind, after all, the address of the father and daughter. Their address, indeed!” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.11.41</span><span class="cts_passage">She gazed fixedly at him. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.11.42</span><span class="cts_passage">“What will you give me?” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.11.43</span><span class="cts_passage">“Anything you like.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.11.44</span><span class="cts_passage">“Anything I like?” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.11.45</span><span class="cts_passage">“Yes.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.11.46</span><span class="cts_passage">“You shall have the address.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.11.47</span><span class="cts_passage">She dropped her head; then, with a brusque movement, she pulled to the door, which closed behind her. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.11.48</span><span class="cts_passage">Marius found himself alone. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.11.49</span><span class="cts_passage">He dropped into a chair, with his head and both elbows on his bed, absorbed in thoughts which he could not grasp, and as though a prey to vertigo. All that had taken place since the morning, the appearance of the angel, her disappearance, what that creature had just said to him, a gleam of hope floating in an immense despair,—this was what filled his brain confusedly. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.11.50</span><span class="cts_passage">All at once he was violently aroused from his reverie. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.11.51</span><span class="cts_passage">He heard the shrill, hard voice of Jondrette utter these words, which were fraught with a strange interest for him:— </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.11.52</span><span class="cts_passage">“I tell you that I am sure of it, and that I recognized him.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.11.53</span><span class="cts_passage">Of whom was Jondrette speaking? Whom had he recognized? M. Leblanc? The father of “his Ursule”? What! Did Jondrette know him? Was Marius about to obtain in this abrupt and unexpected fashion all the information without which his life was so dark to him? Was he about to learn at last who it was that he loved, who that young girl was? Who her father was? Was the dense shadow which enwrapped them on the point of being dispelled? Was the veil about to be rent? Ah! Heavens! </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.11.54</span><span class="cts_passage">He bounded rather than climbed upon his commode, and resumed his post near the little peep-hole in the partition wall. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.11.55</span><span class="cts_passage">Again he beheld the interior of Jondrette’s hovel. </span></div></div>
