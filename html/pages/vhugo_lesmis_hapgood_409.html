<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.8.1.1</span><span class="cts_passage">On the following day, at nightfall, Jean Valjean knocked at the carriage gate of the Gillenormand house. It was Basque who received him. Basque was in the courtyard at the appointed hour, as though he had received his orders. It sometimes happens that one says to a servant: “You will watch for Mr. So and So, when he arrives.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.8.1.2</span><span class="cts_passage">Basque addressed Jean Valjean without waiting for the latter to approach him: </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.8.1.3</span><span class="cts_passage">“Monsieur le Baron has charged me to inquire whether monsieur desires to go upstairs or to remain below?” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.8.1.4</span><span class="cts_passage">“I will remain below,” replied Jean Valjean. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.8.1.5</span><span class="cts_passage">Basque, who was perfectly respectful, opened the door of the waiting-room and said: </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.8.1.6</span><span class="cts_passage">“I will go and inform Madame.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.8.1.7</span><span class="cts_passage">The room which Jean Valjean entered was a damp, vaulted room on the ground floor, which served as a cellar on occasion, which opened on the street, was paved with red squares and was badly lighted by a grated window. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.8.1.8</span><span class="cts_passage">This chamber was not one of those which are harassed by the feather-duster, the pope’s head brush, and the broom. The dust rested tranquilly there. Persecution of the spiders was not organized there. A fine web, which spread far and wide, and was very black and ornamented with dead flies, formed a wheel on one of the window-panes. The room, which was small and low-ceiled, was furnished with a heap of empty bottles piled up in one corner. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.8.1.9</span><span class="cts_passage">The wall, which was daubed with an ochre yellow wash, was scaling off in large flakes. At one end there was a chimney-piece painted in black with a narrow shelf. A fire was burning there; which indicated that Jean Valjean’s reply: “I will remain below,” had been foreseen. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.8.1.10</span><span class="cts_passage">Two armchairs were placed at the two corners of the fireplace. Between the chairs an old bedside rug, which displayed more foundation thread than wool, had been spread by way of a carpet. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.8.1.11</span><span class="cts_passage">The chamber was lighted by the fire on the hearth and the twilight falling through the window. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.8.1.12</span><span class="cts_passage">Jean Valjean was fatigued. For days he had neither eaten nor slept. He threw himself into one of the armchairs. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.8.1.13</span><span class="cts_passage">Basque returned, set a lighted candle on the chimney-piece and retired. Jean Valjean, his head drooping and his chin resting on his breast, perceived neither Basque nor the candle. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.8.1.14</span><span class="cts_passage">All at once, he drew himself up with a start. Cosette was standing beside him. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.8.1.15</span><span class="cts_passage">He had not seen her enter, but he had felt that she was there. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.8.1.16</span><span class="cts_passage">He turned round. He gazed at her. She was adorably lovely. But what he was contemplating with that profound gaze was not her beauty but her soul. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.8.1.17</span><span class="cts_passage">“Well,” exclaimed Cosette, “father, I knew that you were peculiar, but I never should have expected this. What an idea! Marius told me that you wish me to receive you here.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.8.1.18</span><span class="cts_passage">“Yes, it is my wish.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.8.1.19</span><span class="cts_passage">“I expected that reply. Good. I warn you that I am going to make a scene for you. Let us begin at the beginning. Embrace me, father.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.8.1.20</span><span class="cts_passage">And she offered him her cheek. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.8.1.21</span><span class="cts_passage">Jean Valjean remained motionless. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.8.1.22</span><span class="cts_passage">“You do not stir. I take note of it. Attitude of guilt. But never mind, I pardon you. Jesus Christ said: Offer the other cheek. Here it is.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.8.1.23</span><span class="cts_passage">And she presented her other cheek. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.8.1.24</span><span class="cts_passage">Jean Valjean did not move. It seemed as though his feet were nailed to the pavement. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.8.1.25</span><span class="cts_passage">“This is becoming serious,” said Cosette. “What have I done to you? I declare that I am perplexed. You owe me reparation. You will dine with us.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.8.1.26</span><span class="cts_passage">“I have dined.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.8.1.27</span><span class="cts_passage">“That is not true. I will get M. Gillenormand to scold you. Grandfathers are made to reprimand fathers. Come. Go upstairs with me to the drawing-room. Immediately.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.8.1.28</span><span class="cts_passage">“Impossible.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.8.1.29</span><span class="cts_passage">Here Cosette lost ground a little. She ceased to command and passed to questioning. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.8.1.30</span><span class="cts_passage">“But why? and you choose the ugliest chamber in the house in which to see me. It’s horrible here.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.8.1.31</span><span class="cts_passage">“Thou knowest . . .” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.8.1.32</span><span class="cts_passage">Jean Valjean caught himself up. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.8.1.33</span><span class="cts_passage">“You know, madame, that I am peculiar, I have my freaks.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.8.1.34</span><span class="cts_passage">Cosette struck her tiny hands together. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.8.1.35</span><span class="cts_passage">“Madame! . . . You know! . . . more novelties! What is the meaning of this?” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.8.1.36</span><span class="cts_passage">Jean Valjean directed upon her that heartrending smile to which he occasionally had recourse: </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.8.1.37</span><span class="cts_passage">“You wished to be Madame. You are so.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.8.1.38</span><span class="cts_passage">“Not for you, father.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.8.1.39</span><span class="cts_passage">“Do not call me father.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.8.1.40</span><span class="cts_passage">“What?” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.8.1.41</span><span class="cts_passage">“Call me ‘Monsieur Jean.’ ‘Jean,’ if you like.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.8.1.42</span><span class="cts_passage">“You are no longer my father? I am no longer Cosette? ‘Monsieur Jean’? What does this mean? why, these are revolutions, aren’t they? what has taken place? come, look me in the face. And you won’t live with us! And you won’t have my chamber! What have I done to you? Has anything happened?” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.8.1.43</span><span class="cts_passage">“Nothing.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.8.1.44</span><span class="cts_passage">“Well then?” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.8.1.45</span><span class="cts_passage">“Everything is as usual.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.8.1.46</span><span class="cts_passage">“Why do you change your name?” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.8.1.47</span><span class="cts_passage">“You have changed yours, surely.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.8.1.48</span><span class="cts_passage">He smiled again with the same smile as before and added: </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.8.1.49</span><span class="cts_passage">“Since you are Madame Pontmercy, I certainly can be Monsieur Jean.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.8.1.50</span><span class="cts_passage">“I don’t understand anything about it. All this is idiotic. I shall ask permission of my husband for you to be ‘Monsieur Jean.’ I hope that he will not consent to it. You cause me a great deal of pain. One does have freaks, but one does not cause one’s little Cosette grief. That is wrong. You have no right to be wicked, you who are so good.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.8.1.51</span><span class="cts_passage">He made no reply. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.8.1.52</span><span class="cts_passage">She seized his hands with vivacity, and raising them to her face with an irresistible movement, she pressed them against her neck beneath her chin, which is a gesture of profound tenderness. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.8.1.53</span><span class="cts_passage">“Oh!” she said to him, “be good!” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.8.1.54</span><span class="cts_passage">And she went on: </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.8.1.55</span><span class="cts_passage">“This is what I call being good: being nice and coming and living here,—there are birds here as there are in the Rue Plumet,—living with us, quitting that hole of a Rue de l’Homme Armé, not giving us riddles to guess, being like all the rest of the world, dining with us, breakfasting with us, being my father.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.8.1.56</span><span class="cts_passage">He loosed her hands. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.8.1.57</span><span class="cts_passage">“You no longer need a father, you have a husband.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.8.1.58</span><span class="cts_passage">Cosette became angry. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.8.1.59</span><span class="cts_passage">“I no longer need a father! One really does not know what to say to things like that, which are not common sense!” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.8.1.60</span><span class="cts_passage">“If Toussaint were here,” resumed Jean Valjean, like a person who is driven to seek authorities, and who clutches at every branch, “she would be the first to agree that it is true that I have always had ways of my own. There is nothing new in this. I always have loved my black corner.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.8.1.61</span><span class="cts_passage">“But it is cold here. One cannot see distinctly. It is abominable, that it is, to wish to be Monsieur Jean! I will not have you say ‘you’ to me. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.8.1.62</span><span class="cts_passage">“Just now, as I was coming hither,” replied Jean Valjean, “I saw a piece of furniture in the Rue Saint Louis. It was at a cabinet-maker’s. If I were a pretty woman, I would treat myself to that bit of furniture. A very neat toilet table in the reigning style. What you call rosewood, I think. It is inlaid. The mirror is quite large. There are drawers. It is pretty.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.8.1.63</span><span class="cts_passage">“Hou! the villainous bear!” replied Cosette. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.8.1.64</span><span class="cts_passage">And with supreme grace, setting her teeth and drawing back her lips, she blew at Jean Valjean. She was a Grace copying a cat. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.8.1.65</span><span class="cts_passage">“I am furious,” she resumed. “Ever since yesterday, you have made me rage, all of you. I am greatly vexed. I don’t understand. You do not defend me against Marius. Marius will not uphold me against you. I am all alone. I arrange a chamber prettily. If I could have put the good God there I would have done it. My chamber is left on my hands. My lodger sends me into bankruptcy. I order a nice little dinner of Nicolette. We will have nothing to do with your dinner, Madame. And my father Fauchelevent wants me to call him ‘Monsieur Jean,’ and to receive him in a frightful, old, ugly cellar, where the walls have beards, and where the crystal consists of empty bottles, and the curtains are of spiders’ webs! You are singular, I admit, that is your style, but people who get married are granted a truce. You ought not to have begun being singular again instantly. So you are going to be perfectly contented in your abominable Rue de l’Homme Armé. I was very desperate indeed there, that I was. What have you against me? You cause me a great deal of grief. Fi!” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.8.1.66</span><span class="cts_passage">And, becoming suddenly serious, she gazed intently at Jean Valjean and added: </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.8.1.67</span><span class="cts_passage">“Are you angry with me because I am happy?” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.8.1.68</span><span class="cts_passage">Ingenuousness sometimes unconsciously penetrates deep. This question, which was simple for Cosette, was profound for Jean Valjean. Cosette had meant to scratch, and she lacerated. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.8.1.69</span><span class="cts_passage">Jean Valjean turned pale. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.8.1.70</span><span class="cts_passage">He remained for a moment without replying, then, with an inexpressible intonation, and speaking to himself, he murmured: </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.8.1.71</span><span class="cts_passage">“Her happiness was the object of my life. Now God may sign my dismissal. Cosette, thou art happy; my day is over.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.8.1.72</span><span class="cts_passage">“Ah, you have said _thou_ to me!” exclaimed Cosette. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.8.1.73</span><span class="cts_passage">And she sprang to his neck. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.8.1.74</span><span class="cts_passage">Jean Valjean, in bewilderment, strained her wildly to his breast. It almost seemed to him as though he were taking her back. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.8.1.75</span><span class="cts_passage">“Thanks, father!” said Cosette. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.8.1.76</span><span class="cts_passage">This enthusiastic impulse was on the point of becoming poignant for Jean Valjean. He gently removed Cosette’s arms, and took his hat. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.8.1.77</span><span class="cts_passage">“Well?” said Cosette. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.8.1.78</span><span class="cts_passage">“I leave you, Madame, they are waiting for you.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.8.1.79</span><span class="cts_passage">And, from the threshold, he added: </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.8.1.80</span><span class="cts_passage">“I have said _thou_ to you. Tell your husband that this shall not happen again. Pardon me.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.8.1.81</span><span class="cts_passage">Jean Valjean quitted the room, leaving Cosette stupefied at this enigmatical farewell. </span></div></div>
