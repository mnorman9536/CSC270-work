<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">2.8.3.1</span><span class="cts_passage">About a quarter of an hour elapsed. The prioress returned and seated herself once more on her chair. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">2.8.3.2</span><span class="cts_passage">The two interlocutors seemed preoccupied. We will present a stenographic report of the dialogue which then ensued, to the best of our ability. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">2.8.3.3</span><span class="cts_passage">“Father Fauvent!” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">2.8.3.4</span><span class="cts_passage">“Reverend Mother!” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">2.8.3.5</span><span class="cts_passage">“Do you know the chapel?” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">2.8.3.6</span><span class="cts_passage">“I have a little cage there, where I hear the mass and the offices.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">2.8.3.7</span><span class="cts_passage">“And you have been in the choir in pursuance of your duties?” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">2.8.3.8</span><span class="cts_passage">“Two or three times.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">2.8.3.9</span><span class="cts_passage">“There is a stone to be raised.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">2.8.3.10</span><span class="cts_passage">“Heavy?” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">2.8.3.11</span><span class="cts_passage">“The slab of the pavement which is at the side of the altar.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">2.8.3.12</span><span class="cts_passage">“The slab which closes the vault?” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">2.8.3.13</span><span class="cts_passage">“Yes.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">2.8.3.14</span><span class="cts_passage">“It would be a good thing to have two men for it.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">2.8.3.15</span><span class="cts_passage">“Mother Ascension, who is as strong as a man, will help you.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">2.8.3.16</span><span class="cts_passage">“A woman is never a man.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">2.8.3.17</span><span class="cts_passage">“We have only a woman here to help you. Each one does what he can. Because Dom Mabillon gives four hundred and seventeen epistles of Saint Bernard, while Merlonus Horstius only gives three hundred and sixty-seven, I do not despise Merlonus Horstius.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">2.8.3.18</span><span class="cts_passage">“Neither do I.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">2.8.3.19</span><span class="cts_passage">“Merit consists in working according to one’s strength. A cloister is not a dock-yard.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">2.8.3.20</span><span class="cts_passage">“And a woman is not a man. But my brother is the strong one, though!” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">2.8.3.21</span><span class="cts_passage">“And can you get a lever?” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">2.8.3.22</span><span class="cts_passage">“That is the only sort of key that fits that sort of door.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">2.8.3.23</span><span class="cts_passage">“There is a ring in the stone.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">2.8.3.24</span><span class="cts_passage">“I will put the lever through it.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">2.8.3.25</span><span class="cts_passage">“And the stone is so arranged that it swings on a pivot.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">2.8.3.26</span><span class="cts_passage">“That is good, reverend Mother. I will open the vault.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">2.8.3.27</span><span class="cts_passage">“And the four Mother Precentors will help you.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">2.8.3.28</span><span class="cts_passage">“And when the vault is open?” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">2.8.3.29</span><span class="cts_passage">“It must be closed again.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">2.8.3.30</span><span class="cts_passage">“Will that be all?” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">2.8.3.31</span><span class="cts_passage">“No.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">2.8.3.32</span><span class="cts_passage">“Give me your orders, very reverend Mother.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">2.8.3.33</span><span class="cts_passage">“Fauvent, we have confidence in you.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">2.8.3.34</span><span class="cts_passage">“I am here to do anything you wish.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">2.8.3.35</span><span class="cts_passage">“And to hold your peace about everything!” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">2.8.3.36</span><span class="cts_passage">“Yes, reverend Mother.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">2.8.3.37</span><span class="cts_passage">“When the vault is open—” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">2.8.3.38</span><span class="cts_passage">“I will close it again.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">2.8.3.39</span><span class="cts_passage">“But before that—” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">2.8.3.40</span><span class="cts_passage">“What, reverend Mother?” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">2.8.3.41</span><span class="cts_passage">“Something must be lowered into it.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">2.8.3.42</span><span class="cts_passage">A silence ensued. The prioress, after a pout of the under lip which resembled hesitation, broke it. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">2.8.3.43</span><span class="cts_passage">“Father Fauvent!” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">2.8.3.44</span><span class="cts_passage">“Reverend Mother!” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">2.8.3.45</span><span class="cts_passage">“You know that a mother died this morning?” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">2.8.3.46</span><span class="cts_passage">“No.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">2.8.3.47</span><span class="cts_passage">“Did you not hear the bell?” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">2.8.3.48</span><span class="cts_passage">“Nothing can be heard at the bottom of the garden.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">2.8.3.49</span><span class="cts_passage">“Really?” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">2.8.3.50</span><span class="cts_passage">“I can hardly distinguish my own signal.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">2.8.3.51</span><span class="cts_passage">“She died at daybreak.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">2.8.3.52</span><span class="cts_passage">“And then, the wind did not blow in my direction this morning.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">2.8.3.53</span><span class="cts_passage">“It was Mother Crucifixion. A blessed woman.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">2.8.3.54</span><span class="cts_passage">The prioress paused, moved her lips, as though in mental prayer, and resumed:— </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">2.8.3.55</span><span class="cts_passage">“Three years ago, Madame de Béthune, a Jansenist, turned orthodox, merely from having seen Mother Crucifixion at prayer.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">2.8.3.56</span><span class="cts_passage">“Ah! yes, now I hear the knell, reverend Mother.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">2.8.3.57</span><span class="cts_passage">“The mothers have taken her to the dead-room, which opens on the church.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">2.8.3.58</span><span class="cts_passage">“I know.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">2.8.3.59</span><span class="cts_passage">“No other man than you can or must enter that chamber. See to that. A fine sight it would be, to see a man enter the dead-room!” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">2.8.3.60</span><span class="cts_passage">“More often!” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">2.8.3.61</span><span class="cts_passage">“Hey?” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">2.8.3.62</span><span class="cts_passage">“More often!” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">2.8.3.63</span><span class="cts_passage">“What do you say?” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">2.8.3.64</span><span class="cts_passage">“I say more often.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">2.8.3.65</span><span class="cts_passage">“More often than what?” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">2.8.3.66</span><span class="cts_passage">“Reverend Mother, I did not say more often than what, I said more often.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">2.8.3.67</span><span class="cts_passage">“I don’t understand you. Why do you say more often?” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">2.8.3.68</span><span class="cts_passage">“In order to speak like you, reverend Mother.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">2.8.3.69</span><span class="cts_passage">“But I did not say ‘more often.’” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">2.8.3.70</span><span class="cts_passage">At that moment, nine o’clock struck. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">2.8.3.71</span><span class="cts_passage">“At nine o’clock in the morning and at all hours, praised and adored be the most Holy Sacrament of the altar,” said the prioress. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">2.8.3.72</span><span class="cts_passage">“Amen,” said Fauchelevent. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">2.8.3.73</span><span class="cts_passage">The clock struck opportunely. It cut “more often” short. It is probable, that had it not been for this, the prioress and Fauchelevent would never have unravelled that skein. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">2.8.3.74</span><span class="cts_passage">Fauchelevent mopped his forehead. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">2.8.3.75</span><span class="cts_passage">The prioress indulged in another little inward murmur, probably sacred, then raised her voice:— </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">2.8.3.76</span><span class="cts_passage">“In her lifetime, Mother Crucifixion made converts; after her death, she will perform miracles.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">2.8.3.77</span><span class="cts_passage">“She will!” replied Father Fauchelevent, falling into step, and striving not to flinch again. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">2.8.3.78</span><span class="cts_passage">“Father Fauvent, the community has been blessed in Mother Crucifixion. No doubt, it is not granted to every one to die, like Cardinal de Bérulle, while saying the holy mass, and to breathe forth their souls to God, while pronouncing these words: _Hanc igitur oblationem_. But without attaining to such happiness, Mother Crucifixion’s death was very precious. She retained her consciousness to the very last moment. She spoke to us, then she spoke to the angels. She gave us her last commands. If you had a little more faith, and if you could have been in her cell, she would have cured your leg merely by touching it. She smiled. We felt that she was regaining her life in God. There was something of paradise in that death.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">2.8.3.79</span><span class="cts_passage">Fauchelevent thought that it was an orison which she was finishing. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">2.8.3.80</span><span class="cts_passage">“Amen,” said he. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">2.8.3.81</span><span class="cts_passage">“Father Fauvent, what the dead wish must be done.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">2.8.3.82</span><span class="cts_passage">The prioress took off several beads of her chaplet. Fauchelevent held his peace. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">2.8.3.83</span><span class="cts_passage">She went on:— </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">2.8.3.84</span><span class="cts_passage">“I have consulted upon this point many ecclesiastics laboring in Our Lord, who occupy themselves in the exercises of the clerical life, and who bear wonderful fruit.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">2.8.3.85</span><span class="cts_passage">“Reverend Mother, you can hear the knell much better here than in the garden.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">2.8.3.86</span><span class="cts_passage">“Besides, she is more than a dead woman, she is a saint.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">2.8.3.87</span><span class="cts_passage">“Like yourself, reverend Mother.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">2.8.3.88</span><span class="cts_passage">“She slept in her coffin for twenty years, by express permission of our Holy Father, Pius VII.—” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">2.8.3.89</span><span class="cts_passage">“The one who crowned the Emp—Buonaparte.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">2.8.3.90</span><span class="cts_passage">For a clever man like Fauchelevent, this allusion was an awkward one. Fortunately, the prioress, completely absorbed in her own thoughts, did not hear it. She continued:— </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">2.8.3.91</span><span class="cts_passage">“Father Fauvent?” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">2.8.3.92</span><span class="cts_passage">“Reverend Mother?” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">2.8.3.93</span><span class="cts_passage">“Saint Didorus, Archbishop of Cappadocia, desired that this single word might be inscribed on his tomb: _Acarus_, which signifies, a worm of the earth; this was done. Is this true?” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">2.8.3.94</span><span class="cts_passage">“Yes, reverend Mother.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">2.8.3.95</span><span class="cts_passage">“The blessed Mezzocane, Abbot of Aquila, wished to be buried beneath the gallows; this was done.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">2.8.3.96</span><span class="cts_passage">“That is true.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">2.8.3.97</span><span class="cts_passage">“Saint Terentius, Bishop of Port, where the mouth of the Tiber empties into the sea, requested that on his tomb might be engraved the sign which was placed on the graves of parricides, in the hope that passers-by would spit on his tomb. This was done. The dead must be obeyed.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">2.8.3.98</span><span class="cts_passage">“So be it.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">2.8.3.99</span><span class="cts_passage">“The body of Bernard Guidonis, born in France near Roche-Abeille, was, as he had ordered, and in spite of the king of Castile, borne to the church of the Dominicans in Limoges, although Bernard Guidonis was Bishop of Tuy in Spain. Can the contrary be affirmed?” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">2.8.3.100</span><span class="cts_passage">“For that matter, no, reverend Mother.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">2.8.3.101</span><span class="cts_passage">“The fact is attested by Plantavit de la Fosse.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">2.8.3.102</span><span class="cts_passage">Several beads of the chaplet were told off, still in silence. The prioress resumed:— </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">2.8.3.103</span><span class="cts_passage">“Father Fauvent, Mother Crucifixion will be interred in the coffin in which she has slept for the last twenty years.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">2.8.3.104</span><span class="cts_passage">“That is just.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">2.8.3.105</span><span class="cts_passage">“It is a continuation of her slumber.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">2.8.3.106</span><span class="cts_passage">“So I shall have to nail up that coffin?” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">2.8.3.107</span><span class="cts_passage">“Yes.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">2.8.3.108</span><span class="cts_passage">“And we are to reject the undertaker’s coffin?” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">2.8.3.109</span><span class="cts_passage">“Precisely.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">2.8.3.110</span><span class="cts_passage">“I am at the orders of the very reverend community.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">2.8.3.111</span><span class="cts_passage">“The four Mother Precentors will assist you.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">2.8.3.112</span><span class="cts_passage">“In nailing up the coffin? I do not need them.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">2.8.3.113</span><span class="cts_passage">“No. In lowering the coffin.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">2.8.3.114</span><span class="cts_passage">“Where?” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">2.8.3.115</span><span class="cts_passage">“Into the vault.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">2.8.3.116</span><span class="cts_passage">“What vault?” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">2.8.3.117</span><span class="cts_passage">“Under the altar.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">2.8.3.118</span><span class="cts_passage">Fauchelevent started. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">2.8.3.119</span><span class="cts_passage">“The vault under the altar?” </span></div>

<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">2.8.3.121</span><span class="cts_passage">“But—” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">2.8.3.122</span><span class="cts_passage">“You will have an iron bar.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">2.8.3.123</span><span class="cts_passage">“Yes, but—” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">2.8.3.124</span><span class="cts_passage">“You will raise the stone with the bar by means of the ring.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">2.8.3.125</span><span class="cts_passage">“But—” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">2.8.3.126</span><span class="cts_passage">“The dead must be obeyed. To be buried in the vault under the altar of the chapel, not to go to profane earth; to remain there in death where she prayed while living; such was the last wish of Mother Crucifixion. She asked it of us; that is to say, commanded us.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">2.8.3.127</span><span class="cts_passage">“But it is forbidden.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">2.8.3.128</span><span class="cts_passage">“Forbidden by men, enjoined by God.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">2.8.3.129</span><span class="cts_passage">“What if it became known?” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">2.8.3.130</span><span class="cts_passage">“We have confidence in you.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">2.8.3.131</span><span class="cts_passage">“Oh! I am a stone in your walls.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">2.8.3.132</span><span class="cts_passage">“The chapter assembled. The vocal mothers, whom I have just consulted again, and who are now deliberating, have decided that Mother Crucifixion shall be buried, according to her wish, in her own coffin, under our altar. Think, Father Fauvent, if she were to work miracles here! What a glory of God for the community! And miracles issue from tombs.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">2.8.3.133</span><span class="cts_passage">“But, reverend Mother, if the agent of the sanitary commission—” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">2.8.3.134</span><span class="cts_passage">“Saint Benoît II., in the matter of sepulture, resisted Constantine Pogonatus.” </span></div>

<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">2.8.3.139</span><span class="cts_passage">“Amen,” said Fauchelevent, who imperturbably extricated himself in this manner from the dilemma, whenever he heard Latin. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">2.8.3.140</span><span class="cts_passage">Any audience suffices for a person who has held his peace too long. On the day when the rhetorician Gymnastoras left his prison, bearing in his body many dilemmas and numerous syllogisms which had struck in, he halted in front of the first tree which he came to, harangued it and made very great efforts to convince it. The prioress, who was usually subjected to the barrier of silence, and whose reservoir was overfull, rose and exclaimed with the loquacity of a dam which has broken away:— </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">2.8.3.141</span><span class="cts_passage">“I have on my right Benoît and on my left Bernard. Who was Bernard? The first abbot of Clairvaux. Fontaines in Burgundy is a country that is blest because it gave him birth. His father was named Técelin, and his mother Alèthe. He began at Cîteaux, to end in Clairvaux; he was ordained abbot by the bishop of Châlon-sur-Saône, Guillaume de Champeaux; he had seven hundred novices, and founded a hundred and sixty monasteries; he overthrew Abeilard at the council of Sens in 1140, and Pierre de Bruys and Henry his disciple, and another sort of erring spirits who were called the Apostolics; he confounded Arnauld de Brescia, darted lightning at the monk Raoul, the murderer of the Jews, dominated the council of Reims in 1148, caused the condemnation of Gilbert de Poréa, Bishop of Poitiers, caused the condemnation of Éon de l‘Étoile, arranged the disputes of princes, enlightened King Louis the Young, advised Pope Eugene III., regulated the Temple, preached the crusade, performed two hundred and fifty miracles during his lifetime, and as many as thirty-nine in one day. Who was Benoît? He was the patriarch of Mont-Cassin; he was the second founder of the Sainteté Claustrale, he was the Basil of the West. His order has produced forty popes, two hundred cardinals, fifty patriarchs, sixteen hundred archbishops, four thousand six hundred bishops, four emperors, twelve empresses, forty-six kings, forty-one queens, three thousand six hundred canonized saints, and has been in existence for fourteen hundred years. On one side Saint Bernard, on the other the agent of the sanitary department! On one side Saint Benoît, on the other the inspector of public ways! The state, the road commissioners, the public undertaker, regulations, the administration, what do we know of all that? There is not a chance passer-by who would not be indignant to see how we are treated. We have not even the right to give our dust to Jesus Christ! Your sanitary department is a revolutionary invention. God subordinated to the commissary of police; such is the age. Silence, Fauvent!” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">2.8.3.142</span><span class="cts_passage">Fauchelevent was but ill at ease under this shower bath. The prioress continued:— </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">2.8.3.143</span><span class="cts_passage">“No one doubts the right of the monastery to sepulture. Only fanatics and those in error deny it. We live in times of terrible confusion. We do not know that which it is necessary to know, and we know that which we should ignore. We are ignorant and impious. In this age there exist people who do not distinguish between the very great Saint Bernard and the Saint Bernard denominated of the poor Catholics, a certain good ecclesiastic who lived in the thirteenth century. Others are so blasphemous as to compare the scaffold of Louis XVI. to the cross of Jesus Christ. Louis XVI. was merely a king. Let us beware of God! There is no longer just nor unjust. The name of Voltaire is known, but not the name of César de Bus. Nevertheless, César de Bus is a man of blessed memory, and Voltaire one of unblessed memory. The last arch-bishop, the Cardinal de Périgord, did not even know that Charles de Gondren succeeded to Berulle, and François Bourgoin to Gondren, and Jean-François Senault to Bourgoin, and Father Sainte-Marthe to Jean-François Senault. The name of Father Coton is known, not because he was one of the three who urged the foundation of the Oratorie, but because he furnished Henri IV., the Huguenot king, with the material for an oath. That which pleases people of the world in Saint François de Sales, is that he cheated at play. And then, religion is attacked. Why? Because there have been bad priests, because Sagittaire, Bishop of Gap, was the brother of Salone, Bishop of Embrun, and because both of them followed Mommol. What has that to do with the question? Does that prevent Martin de Tours from being a saint, and giving half of his cloak to a beggar? They persecute the saints. They shut their eyes to the truth. Darkness is the rule. The most ferocious beasts are beasts which are blind. No one thinks of hell as a reality. Oh! how wicked people are! By order of the king signifies to-day, by order of the revolution. One no longer knows what is due to the living or to the dead. A holy death is prohibited. Burial is a civil matter. This is horrible. Saint Leo II. wrote two special letters, one to Pierre Notaire, the other to the king of the Visigoths, for the purpose of combating and rejecting, in questions touching the dead, the authority of the exarch and the supremacy of the Emperor. Gauthier, Bishop of Châlons, held his own in this matter against Otho, Duke of Burgundy. The ancient magistracy agreed with him. In former times we had voices in the chapter, even on matters of the day. The Abbot of Cîteaux, the general of the order, was councillor by right of birth to the parliament of Burgundy. We do what we please with our dead. Is not the body of Saint Benoît himself in France, in the abbey of Fleury, called Saint Benoît-sur-Loire, although he died in Italy at Mont-Cassin, on Saturday, the 21st of the month of March, of the year 543? All this is incontestable. I abhor psalm-singers, I hate priors, I execrate heretics, but I should detest yet more any one who should maintain the contrary. One has only to read Arnoul Wion, Gabriel Bucelin, Trithemus, Maurolics, and Dom Luc d’Achery.” </span></div>
