			<div class="cts_corpus"><div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.1.18.head</span><span class="cts_passage">CHAPTER XVIII—THE VULTURE BECOME PREY </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.1.18.1</span><span class="cts_passage">We must insist upon one psychological fact peculiar to barricades. Nothing which is characteristic of that surprising war of the streets should be omitted. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.1.18.2</span><span class="cts_passage">Whatever may have been the singular inward tranquillity which we have just mentioned, the barricade, for those who are inside it, remains, nonetheless, a vision. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.1.18.3</span><span class="cts_passage">There is something of the apocalypse in civil war, all the mists of the unknown are commingled with fierce flashes, revolutions are sphinxes, and any one who has passed through a barricade thinks he has traversed a dream. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.1.18.4</span><span class="cts_passage">The feelings to which one is subject in these places we have pointed out in the case of Marius, and we shall see the consequences; they are both more and less than life. On emerging from a barricade, one no longer knows what one has seen there. One has been terrible, but one knows it not. One has been surrounded with conflicting ideas which had human faces; one’s head has been in the light of the future. There were corpses lying prone there, and phantoms standing erect. The hours were colossal and seemed hours of eternity. One has lived in death. Shadows have passed by. What were they? </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.1.18.5</span><span class="cts_passage">One has beheld hands on which there was blood; there was a deafening horror; there was also a frightful silence; there were open mouths which shouted, and other open mouths which held their peace; one was in the midst of smoke, of night, perhaps. One fancied that one had touched the sinister ooze of unknown depths; one stares at something red on one’s finger nails. One no longer remembers anything. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.1.18.6</span><span class="cts_passage">Let us return to the Rue de la Chanvrerie. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.1.18.7</span><span class="cts_passage">All at once, between two discharges, the distant sound of a clock striking the hour became audible. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.1.18.8</span><span class="cts_passage">“It is midday,” said Combeferre. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.1.18.9</span><span class="cts_passage">The twelve strokes had not finished striking when Enjolras sprang to his feet, and from the summit of the barricade hurled this thundering shout: </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.1.18.10</span><span class="cts_passage">“Carry stones up into the houses; line the windowsills and the roofs with them. Half the men to their guns, the other half to the paving-stones. There is not a minute to be lost.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.1.18.11</span><span class="cts_passage">A squad of sappers and miners, axe on shoulder, had just made their appearance in battle array at the end of the street. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.1.18.12</span><span class="cts_passage">This could only be the head of a column; and of what column? The attacking column, evidently; the sappers charged with the demolition of the barricade must always precede the soldiers who are to scale it. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.1.18.13</span><span class="cts_passage">They were, evidently, on the brink of that moment which M. Clermont-Tonnerre, in 1822, called “the tug of war.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.1.18.14</span><span class="cts_passage">Enjolras’ order was executed with the correct haste which is peculiar to ships and barricades, the only two scenes of combat where escape is impossible. In less than a minute, two thirds of the stones which Enjolras had had piled up at the door of Corinthe had been carried up to the first floor and the attic, and before a second minute had elapsed, these stones, artistically set one upon the other, walled up the sash-window on the first floor and the windows in the roof to half their height. A few loop-holes carefully planned by Feuilly, the principal architect, allowed of the passage of the gun-barrels. This armament of the windows could be effected all the more easily since the firing of grape-shot had ceased. The two cannons were now discharging ball against the centre of the barrier in order to make a hole there, and, if possible, a breach for the assault. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.1.18.15</span><span class="cts_passage">When the stones destined to the final defence were in place, Enjolras had the bottles which he had set under the table where Mabeuf lay, carried to the first floor. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.1.18.16</span><span class="cts_passage">“Who is to drink that?” Bossuet asked him. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.1.18.17</span><span class="cts_passage">“They,” replied Enjolras. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.1.18.18</span><span class="cts_passage">Then they barricaded the window below, and held in readiness the iron cross-bars which served to secure the door of the wine-shop at night. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.1.18.19</span><span class="cts_passage">The fortress was complete. The barricade was the rampart, the wine-shop was the dungeon. With the stones which remained they stopped up the outlet. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.1.18.20</span><span class="cts_passage">As the defenders of a barricade are always obliged to be sparing of their ammunition, and as the assailants know this, the assailants combine their arrangements with a sort of irritating leisure, expose themselves to fire prematurely, though in appearance more than in reality, and take their ease. The preparations for attack are always made with a certain methodical deliberation; after which, the lightning strikes. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.1.18.21</span><span class="cts_passage">This deliberation permitted Enjolras to take a review of everything and to perfect everything. He felt that, since such men were to die, their death ought to be a masterpiece. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.1.18.22</span><span class="cts_passage">He said to Marius: “We are the two leaders. I will give the last orders inside. Do you remain outside and observe.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.1.18.23</span><span class="cts_passage">Marius posted himself on the lookout upon the crest of the barricade. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.1.18.24</span><span class="cts_passage">Enjolras had the door of the kitchen, which was the ambulance, as the reader will remember, nailed up. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.1.18.25</span><span class="cts_passage">“No splashing of the wounded,” he said. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.1.18.26</span><span class="cts_passage">He issued his final orders in the tap-room in a curt, but profoundly tranquil tone; Feuilly listened and replied in the name of all. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.1.18.27</span><span class="cts_passage">“On the first floor, hold your axes in readiness to cut the staircase. Have you them?” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.1.18.28</span><span class="cts_passage">“Yes,” said Feuilly. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.1.18.29</span><span class="cts_passage">“How many?” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.1.18.30</span><span class="cts_passage">“Two axes and a pole-axe.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.1.18.31</span><span class="cts_passage">“That is good. There are now twenty-six combatants of us on foot. How many guns are there?” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.1.18.32</span><span class="cts_passage">“Thirty-four.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.1.18.33</span><span class="cts_passage">“Eight too many. Keep those eight guns loaded like the rest and at hand. Swords and pistols in your belts. Twenty men to the barricade. Six ambushed in the attic windows, and at the window on the first floor to fire on the assailants through the loop-holes in the stones. Let not a single worker remain inactive here. Presently, when the drum beats the assault, let the twenty below stairs rush to the barricade. The first to arrive will have the best places.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.1.18.34</span><span class="cts_passage">These arrangements made, he turned to Javert and said: </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.1.18.35</span><span class="cts_passage">“I am not forgetting you.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.1.18.36</span><span class="cts_passage">And, laying a pistol on the table, he added: </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.1.18.37</span><span class="cts_passage">“The last man to leave this room will smash the skull of this spy.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.1.18.38</span><span class="cts_passage">“Here?” inquired a voice. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.1.18.39</span><span class="cts_passage">“No, let us not mix their corpses with our own. The little barricade of the Mondétour lane can be scaled. It is only four feet high. The man is well pinioned. He shall be taken thither and put to death.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.1.18.40</span><span class="cts_passage">There was some one who was more impassive at that moment than Enjolras, it was Javert. Here Jean Valjean made his appearance. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.1.18.41</span><span class="cts_passage">He had been lost among the group of insurgents. He stepped forth and said to Enjolras: </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.1.18.42</span><span class="cts_passage">“You are the commander?” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.1.18.43</span><span class="cts_passage">“Yes.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.1.18.44</span><span class="cts_passage">“You thanked me a while ago.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.1.18.45</span><span class="cts_passage">“In the name of the Republic. The barricade has two saviors, Marius Pontmercy and yourself.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.1.18.46</span><span class="cts_passage">“Do you think that I deserve a recompense?” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.1.18.47</span><span class="cts_passage">“Certainly.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.1.18.48</span><span class="cts_passage">“Well, I request one.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.1.18.49</span><span class="cts_passage">“What is it?” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.1.18.50</span><span class="cts_passage">“That I may blow that man’s brains out.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.1.18.51</span><span class="cts_passage">Javert raised his head, saw Jean Valjean, made an almost imperceptible movement, and said: </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.1.18.52</span><span class="cts_passage">“That is just.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.1.18.53</span><span class="cts_passage">As for Enjolras, he had begun to re-load his rifle; he cut his eyes about him: </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.1.18.54</span><span class="cts_passage">“No objections.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.1.18.55</span><span class="cts_passage">And he turned to Jean Valjean: </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.1.18.56</span><span class="cts_passage">“Take the spy.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.1.18.57</span><span class="cts_passage">Jean Valjean did, in fact, take possession of Javert, by seating himself on the end of the table. He seized the pistol, and a faint click announced that he had cocked it. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.1.18.58</span><span class="cts_passage">Almost at the same moment, a blast of trumpets became audible. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.1.18.59</span><span class="cts_passage">“Take care!” shouted Marius from the top of the barricade. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.1.18.60</span><span class="cts_passage">Javert began to laugh with that noiseless laugh which was peculiar to him, and gazing intently at the insurgents, he said to them: </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.1.18.61</span><span class="cts_passage">“You are in no better case than I am.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.1.18.62</span><span class="cts_passage">“All out!” shouted Enjolras. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.1.18.63</span><span class="cts_passage">The insurgents poured out tumultuously, and, as they went, received in the back,—may we be permitted the expression,—this sally of Javert’s: </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.1.18.64</span><span class="cts_passage">“We shall meet again shortly!” </span></div></div>
