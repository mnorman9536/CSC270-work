<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.5.3.1</span><span class="cts_passage">One day, M. Gillenormand, while his daughter was putting in order the phials and cups on the marble of the commode, bent over Marius and said to him in his tenderest accents: “Look here, my little Marius, if I were in your place, I would eat meat now in preference to fish. A fried sole is excellent to begin a convalescence with, but a good cutlet is needed to put a sick man on his feet.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.5.3.2</span><span class="cts_passage">Marius, who had almost entirely recovered his strength, collected the whole of it, drew himself up into a sitting posture, laid his two clenched fists on the sheets of his bed, looked his grandfather in the face, assumed a terrible air, and said: </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.5.3.3</span><span class="cts_passage">“This leads me to say something to you.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.5.3.4</span><span class="cts_passage">“What is it?” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.5.3.5</span><span class="cts_passage">“That I wish to marry.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.5.3.6</span><span class="cts_passage">“Agreed,” said his grandfather.—And he burst out laughing. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.5.3.7</span><span class="cts_passage">“How agreed?” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.5.3.8</span><span class="cts_passage">“Yes, agreed. You shall have your little girl.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.5.3.9</span><span class="cts_passage">Marius, stunned and overwhelmed with the dazzling shock, trembled in every limb. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.5.3.10</span><span class="cts_passage">M. Gillenormand went on: </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.5.3.11</span><span class="cts_passage">“Yes, you shall have her, that pretty little girl of yours. She comes every day in the shape of an old gentleman to inquire after you. Ever since you were wounded, she has passed her time in weeping and making lint. I have made inquiries. She lives in the Rue de l’Homme Armé, No. 7. Ah! There we have it! Ah! so you want her! Well, you shall have her. You’re caught. You had arranged your little plot, you had said to yourself:—‘I’m going to signify this squarely to my grandfather, to that mummy of the Regency and of the Directory, to that ancient beau, to that Dorante turned Géronte; he has indulged in his frivolities also, that he has, and he has had his love affairs, and his grisettes and his Cosettes; he has made his rustle, he has had his wings, he has eaten of the bread of spring; he certainly must remember it.’ Ah! you take the cockchafer by the horns. That’s good. I offer you a cutlet and you answer me: ‘By the way, I want to marry.’ There’s a transition for you! Ah! you reckoned on a bickering! You do not know that I am an old coward. What do you say to that? You are vexed? You did not expect to find your grandfather still more foolish than yourself, you are wasting the discourse which you meant to bestow upon me, Mr. Lawyer, and that’s vexatious. Well, so much the worse, rage away. I’ll do whatever you wish, and that cuts you short, imbecile! Listen. I have made my inquiries, I’m cunning too; she is charming, she is discreet, it is not true about the lancer, she has made heaps of lint, she’s a jewel, she adores you, if you had died, there would have been three of us, her coffin would have accompanied mine. I have had an idea, ever since you have been better, of simply planting her at your bedside, but it is only in romances that young girls are brought to the bedsides of handsome young wounded men who interest them. It is not done. What would your aunt have said to it? You were nude three quarters of the time, my good fellow. Ask Nicolette, who has not left you for a moment, if there was any possibility of having a woman here. And then, what would the doctor have said? A pretty girl does not cure a man of fever. In short, it’s all right, let us say no more about it, all’s said, all’s done, it’s all settled, take her. Such is my ferocity. You see, I perceived that you did not love me. I said to myself: ‘Here now, I have my little Cosette right under my hand, I’m going to give her to him, he will be obliged to love me a little then, or he must tell the reason why.’ Ah! so you thought that the old man was going to storm, to put on a big voice, to shout no, and to lift his cane at all that aurora. Not a bit of it. Cosette, so be it; love, so be it; I ask nothing better. Pray take the trouble of getting married, sir. Be happy, my well-beloved child.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.5.3.12</span><span class="cts_passage">That said, the old man burst forth into sobs. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.5.3.13</span><span class="cts_passage">And he seized Marius’ head, and pressed it with both arms against his breast, and both fell to weeping. This is one of the forms of supreme happiness. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.5.3.14</span><span class="cts_passage">“Father!” cried Marius. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.5.3.15</span><span class="cts_passage">“Ah, so you love me!” said the old man. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.5.3.16</span><span class="cts_passage">An ineffable moment ensued. They were choking and could not speak. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.5.3.17</span><span class="cts_passage">At length the old man stammered: </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.5.3.18</span><span class="cts_passage">“Come! his mouth is unstopped at last. He has said: ‘Father’ to me.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.5.3.19</span><span class="cts_passage">Marius disengaged his head from his grandfather’s arms, and said gently: </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.5.3.20</span><span class="cts_passage">“But, father, now that I am quite well, it seems to me that I might see her.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.5.3.21</span><span class="cts_passage">“Agreed again, you shall see her to-morrow.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.5.3.22</span><span class="cts_passage">“Father!” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.5.3.23</span><span class="cts_passage">“What?” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.5.3.24</span><span class="cts_passage">“Why not to-day?” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.5.3.25</span><span class="cts_passage">“Well, to-day then. Let it be to-day. You have called me ‘father’ three times, and it is worth it. I will attend to it. She shall be brought hither. Agreed, I tell you. It has already been put into verse. This is the ending of the elegy of the ‘Jeune Malade’ by André Chénier, by André Chénier whose throat was cut by the ras . . . by the giants of ’93.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.5.3.26</span><span class="cts_passage">M. Gillenormand fancied that he detected a faint frown on the part of Marius, who, in truth, as we must admit, was no longer listening to him, and who was thinking far more of Cosette than of 1793. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.5.3.27</span><span class="cts_passage">The grandfather, trembling at having so inopportunely introduced André Chénier, resumed precipitately: </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.5.3.28</span><span class="cts_passage">“Cut his throat is not the word. The fact is that the great revolutionary geniuses, who were not malicious, that is incontestable, who were heroes, pardi! found that André Chénier embarrassed them somewhat, and they had him guillot . . . that is to say, those great men on the 7th of Thermidor, besought André Chénier, in the interests of public safety, to be so good as to go….” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.5.3.29</span><span class="cts_passage">M. Gillenormand, clutched by the throat by his own phrase, could not proceed. Being able neither to finish it nor to retract it, while his daughter arranged the pillow behind Marius, who was overwhelmed with so many emotions, the old man rushed headlong, with as much rapidity as his age permitted, from the bed-chamber, shut the door behind him, and, purple, choking and foaming at the mouth, his eyes starting from his head, he found himself nose to nose with honest Basque, who was blacking boots in the anteroom. He seized Basque by the collar, and shouted full in his face in fury:—“By the hundred thousand Javottes of the devil, those ruffians did assassinate him!” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.5.3.30</span><span class="cts_passage">“Who, sir?” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.5.3.31</span><span class="cts_passage">“André Chénier!” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.5.3.32</span><span class="cts_passage">“Yes, sir,” said Basque in alarm. </span></div></div>
