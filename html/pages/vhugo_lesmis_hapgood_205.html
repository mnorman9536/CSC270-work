<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.4.6.1</span><span class="cts_passage">That evening left Marius profoundly shaken, and with a melancholy shadow in his soul. He felt what the earth may possibly feel, at the moment when it is torn open with the iron, in order that grain may be deposited within it; it feels only the wound; the quiver of the germ and the joy of the fruit only arrive later. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.4.6.2</span><span class="cts_passage">Marius was gloomy. He had but just acquired a faith; must he then reject it already? He affirmed to himself that he would not. He declared to himself that he would not doubt, and he began to doubt in spite of himself. To stand between two religions, from one of which you have not as yet emerged, and another into which you have not yet entered, is intolerable; and twilight is pleasing only to bat-like souls. Marius was clear-eyed, and he required the true light. The half-lights of doubt pained him. Whatever may have been his desire to remain where he was, he could not halt there, he was irresistibly constrained to continue, to advance, to examine, to think, to march further. Whither would this lead him? He feared, after having taken so many steps which had brought him nearer to his father, to now take a step which should estrange him from that father. His discomfort was augmented by all the reflections which occurred to him. An escarpment rose around him. He was in accord neither with his grandfather nor with his friends; daring in the eyes of the one, he was behind the times in the eyes of the others, and he recognized the fact that he was doubly isolated, on the side of age and on the side of youth. He ceased to go to the Café Musain. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.4.6.3</span><span class="cts_passage">In the troubled state of his conscience, he no longer thought of certain serious sides of existence. The realities of life do not allow themselves to be forgotten. They soon elbowed him abruptly. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.4.6.4</span><span class="cts_passage">One morning, the proprietor of the hotel entered Marius’ room and said to him:— </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.4.6.5</span><span class="cts_passage">“Monsieur Courfeyrac answered for you.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.4.6.6</span><span class="cts_passage">“Yes.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.4.6.7</span><span class="cts_passage">“But I must have my money.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.4.6.8</span><span class="cts_passage">“Request Courfeyrac to come and talk with me,” said Marius. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.4.6.9</span><span class="cts_passage">Courfeyrac having made his appearance, the host left them. Marius then told him what it had not before occurred to him to relate, that he was the same as alone in the world, and had no relatives. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.4.6.10</span><span class="cts_passage">“What is to become of you?” said Courfeyrac. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.4.6.11</span><span class="cts_passage">“I do not know in the least,” replied Marius. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.4.6.12</span><span class="cts_passage">“What are you going to do?” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.4.6.13</span><span class="cts_passage">“I do not know.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.4.6.14</span><span class="cts_passage">“Have you any money?” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.4.6.15</span><span class="cts_passage">“Fifteen francs.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.4.6.16</span><span class="cts_passage">“Do you want me to lend you some?” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.4.6.17</span><span class="cts_passage">“Never.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.4.6.18</span><span class="cts_passage">“Have you clothes?” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.4.6.19</span><span class="cts_passage">“Here is what I have.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.4.6.20</span><span class="cts_passage">“Have you trinkets?” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.4.6.21</span><span class="cts_passage">“A watch.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.4.6.22</span><span class="cts_passage">“Silver?” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.4.6.23</span><span class="cts_passage">“Gold; here it is.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.4.6.24</span><span class="cts_passage">“I know a clothes-dealer who will take your frock-coat and a pair of trousers.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.4.6.25</span><span class="cts_passage">“That is good.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.4.6.26</span><span class="cts_passage">“You will then have only a pair of trousers, a waistcoat, a hat and a coat.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.4.6.27</span><span class="cts_passage">“And my boots.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.4.6.28</span><span class="cts_passage">“What! you will not go barefoot? What opulence!” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.4.6.29</span><span class="cts_passage">“That will be enough.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.4.6.30</span><span class="cts_passage">“I know a watchmaker who will buy your watch.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.4.6.31</span><span class="cts_passage">“That is good.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.4.6.32</span><span class="cts_passage">“No; it is not good. What will you do after that?” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.4.6.33</span><span class="cts_passage">“Whatever is necessary. Anything honest, that is to say.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.4.6.34</span><span class="cts_passage">“Do you know English?” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.4.6.35</span><span class="cts_passage">“No.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.4.6.36</span><span class="cts_passage">“Do you know German?” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.4.6.37</span><span class="cts_passage">“No.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.4.6.38</span><span class="cts_passage">“So much the worse.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.4.6.39</span><span class="cts_passage">“Why?” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.4.6.40</span><span class="cts_passage">“Because one of my friends, a publisher, is getting up a sort of an encyclopædia, for which you might have translated English or German articles. It is badly paid work, but one can live by it.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.4.6.41</span><span class="cts_passage">“I will learn English and German.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.4.6.42</span><span class="cts_passage">“And in the meanwhile?” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.4.6.43</span><span class="cts_passage">“In the meanwhile I will live on my clothes and my watch.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.4.6.44</span><span class="cts_passage">The clothes-dealer was sent for. He paid twenty francs for the cast-off garments. They went to the watchmaker’s. He bought the watch for forty-five francs. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.4.6.45</span><span class="cts_passage">“That is not bad,” said Marius to Courfeyrac, on their return to the hotel, “with my fifteen francs, that makes eighty.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.4.6.46</span><span class="cts_passage">“And the hotel bill?” observed Courfeyrac. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.4.6.47</span><span class="cts_passage">“Hello, I had forgotten that,” said Marius. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.4.6.48</span><span class="cts_passage">The landlord presented his bill, which had to be paid on the spot. It amounted to seventy francs. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.4.6.49</span><span class="cts_passage">“I have ten francs left,” said Marius. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.4.6.50</span><span class="cts_passage">“The deuce,” exclaimed Courfeyrac, “you will eat up five francs while you are learning English, and five while learning German. That will be swallowing a tongue very fast, or a hundred sous very slowly.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.4.6.51</span><span class="cts_passage">In the meantime Aunt Gillenormand, a rather good-hearted person at bottom in difficulties, had finally hunted up Marius’ abode. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.4.6.52</span><span class="cts_passage">One morning, on his return from the law-school, Marius found a letter from his aunt, and the _sixty pistoles_, that is to say, six hundred francs in gold, in a sealed box. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.4.6.53</span><span class="cts_passage">Marius sent back the thirty louis to his aunt, with a respectful letter, in which he stated that he had sufficient means of subsistence and that he should be able thenceforth to supply all his needs. At that moment, he had three francs left. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.4.6.54</span><span class="cts_passage">His aunt did not inform his grandfather of this refusal for fear of exasperating him. Besides, had he not said: “Let me never hear the name of that blood-drinker again!” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.4.6.55</span><span class="cts_passage">Marius left the hotel de la Porte Saint-Jacques, as he did not wish to run in debt there. </span></div></div>
