			<div class="cts_corpus"><div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">4.14.6.head</span><span class="cts_passage">CHAPTER VI—THE AGONY OF DEATH AFTER THE AGONY OF LIFE </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">4.14.6.1</span><span class="cts_passage">A peculiarity of this species of war is, that the attack of the barricades is almost always made from the front, and that the assailants generally abstain from turning the position, either because they fear ambushes, or because they are afraid of getting entangled in the tortuous streets. The insurgents’ whole attention had been directed, therefore, to the grand barricade, which was, evidently, the spot always menaced, and there the struggle would infallibly recommence. But Marius thought of the little barricade, and went thither. It was deserted and guarded only by the fire-pot which trembled between the paving-stones. Moreover, the Mondétour alley, and the branches of the Rue de la Petite Truanderie and the Rue du Cygne were profoundly calm. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">4.14.6.2</span><span class="cts_passage">As Marius was withdrawing, after concluding his inspection, he heard his name pronounced feebly in the darkness. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">4.14.6.3</span><span class="cts_passage">“Monsieur Marius!” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">4.14.6.4</span><span class="cts_passage">He started, for he recognized the voice which had called to him two hours before through the gate in the Rue Plumet. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">4.14.6.5</span><span class="cts_passage">Only, the voice now seemed to be nothing more than a breath. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">4.14.6.6</span><span class="cts_passage">He looked about him, but saw no one. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">4.14.6.7</span><span class="cts_passage">Marius thought he had been mistaken, that it was an illusion added by his mind to the extraordinary realities which were clashing around him. He advanced a step, in order to quit the distant recess where the barricade lay. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">4.14.6.8</span><span class="cts_passage">“Monsieur Marius!” repeated the voice. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">4.14.6.9</span><span class="cts_passage">This time he could not doubt that he had heard it distinctly; he looked and saw nothing. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">4.14.6.10</span><span class="cts_passage">“At your feet,” said the voice. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">4.14.6.11</span><span class="cts_passage">He bent down, and saw in the darkness a form which was dragging itself towards him. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">4.14.6.12</span><span class="cts_passage">It was crawling along the pavement. It was this that had spoken to him. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">4.14.6.13</span><span class="cts_passage">The fire-pot allowed him to distinguish a blouse, torn trousers of coarse velvet, bare feet, and something which resembled a pool of blood. Marius indistinctly made out a pale head which was lifted towards him and which was saying to him:— </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">4.14.6.14</span><span class="cts_passage">“You do not recognize me?” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">4.14.6.15</span><span class="cts_passage">“No.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">4.14.6.16</span><span class="cts_passage">“Éponine.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">4.14.6.17</span><span class="cts_passage">Marius bent hastily down. It was, in fact, that unhappy child. She was dressed in men’s clothes. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">4.14.6.18</span><span class="cts_passage">“How come you here? What are you doing here?” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">4.14.6.19</span><span class="cts_passage">“I am dying,” said she. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">4.14.6.20</span><span class="cts_passage">There are words and incidents which arouse dejected beings. Marius cried out with a start:— </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">4.14.6.21</span><span class="cts_passage">“You are wounded! Wait, I will carry you into the room! They will attend to you there. Is it serious? How must I take hold of you in order not to hurt you? Where do you suffer? Help! My God! But why did you come hither?” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">4.14.6.22</span><span class="cts_passage">And he tried to pass his arm under her, in order to raise her. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">4.14.6.23</span><span class="cts_passage">She uttered a feeble cry. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">4.14.6.24</span><span class="cts_passage">“Have I hurt you?” asked Marius. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">4.14.6.25</span><span class="cts_passage">“A little.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">4.14.6.26</span><span class="cts_passage">“But I only touched your hand.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">4.14.6.27</span><span class="cts_passage">She raised her hand to Marius, and in the middle of that hand Marius saw a black hole. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">4.14.6.28</span><span class="cts_passage">“What is the matter with your hand?” said he. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">4.14.6.29</span><span class="cts_passage">“It is pierced.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">4.14.6.30</span><span class="cts_passage">“Pierced?” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">4.14.6.31</span><span class="cts_passage">“Yes.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">4.14.6.32</span><span class="cts_passage">“What with?” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">4.14.6.33</span><span class="cts_passage">“A bullet.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">4.14.6.34</span><span class="cts_passage">“How?” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">4.14.6.35</span><span class="cts_passage">“Did you see a gun aimed at you?” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">4.14.6.36</span><span class="cts_passage">“Yes, and a hand stopping it.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">4.14.6.37</span><span class="cts_passage">“It was mine.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">4.14.6.38</span><span class="cts_passage">Marius was seized with a shudder. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">4.14.6.39</span><span class="cts_passage">“What madness! Poor child! But so much the better, if that is all, it is nothing, let me carry you to a bed. They will dress your wound; one does not die of a pierced hand.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">4.14.6.40</span><span class="cts_passage">She murmured:— </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">4.14.6.41</span><span class="cts_passage">“The bullet traversed my hand, but it came out through my back. It is useless to remove me from this spot. I will tell you how you can care for me better than any surgeon. Sit down near me on this stone.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">4.14.6.42</span><span class="cts_passage">He obeyed; she laid her head on Marius’ knees, and, without looking at him, she said:— </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">4.14.6.43</span><span class="cts_passage">“Oh! How good this is! How comfortable this is! There; I no longer suffer.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">4.14.6.44</span><span class="cts_passage">She remained silent for a moment, then she turned her face with an effort, and looked at Marius. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">4.14.6.45</span><span class="cts_passage">“Do you know what, Monsieur Marius? It puzzled me because you entered that garden; it was stupid, because it was I who showed you that house; and then, I ought to have said to myself that a young man like you—” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">4.14.6.46</span><span class="cts_passage">She paused, and overstepping the sombre transitions that undoubtedly existed in her mind, she resumed with a heartrending smile:— </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">4.14.6.47</span><span class="cts_passage">“You thought me ugly, didn’t you?” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">4.14.6.48</span><span class="cts_passage">She continued:— </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">4.14.6.49</span><span class="cts_passage">“You see, you are lost! Now, no one can get out of the barricade. It was I who led you here, by the way! You are going to die, I count upon that. And yet, when I saw them taking aim at you, I put my hand on the muzzle of the gun. How queer it is! But it was because I wanted to die before you. When I received that bullet, I dragged myself here, no one saw me, no one picked me up, I was waiting for you, I said: ‘So he is not coming!’ Oh, if you only knew. I bit my blouse, I suffered so! Now I am well. Do you remember the day I entered your chamber and when I looked at myself in your mirror, and the day when I came to you on the boulevard near the washerwomen? How the birds sang! That was a long time ago. You gave me a hundred sous, and I said to you: ‘I don’t want your money.’ I hope you picked up your coin? You are not rich. I did not think to tell you to pick it up. The sun was shining bright, and it was not cold. Do you remember, Monsieur Marius? Oh! How happy I am! Every one is going to die.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">4.14.6.50</span><span class="cts_passage">She had a mad, grave, and heart-breaking air. Her torn blouse disclosed her bare throat. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">4.14.6.51</span><span class="cts_passage">As she talked, she pressed her pierced hand to her breast, where there was another hole, and whence there spurted from moment to moment a stream of blood, like a jet of wine from an open bung-hole. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">4.14.6.52</span><span class="cts_passage">Marius gazed at this unfortunate creature with profound compassion. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">4.14.6.53</span><span class="cts_passage">“Oh!” she resumed, “it is coming again, I am stifling!” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">4.14.6.54</span><span class="cts_passage">She caught up her blouse and bit it, and her limbs stiffened on the pavement. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">4.14.6.55</span><span class="cts_passage">At that moment the young cock’s crow executed by little Gavroche resounded through the barricade. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">4.14.6.56</span><span class="cts_passage">The child had mounted a table to load his gun, and was singing gayly the song then so popular:— </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">4.14.6.57</span><span class="cts_passage">“En voyant Lafayette, “On beholding Lafayette, Le gendarme répète:— The gendarme repeats:— Sauvons nous! sauvons nous! Let us flee! let us flee! sauvons nous!” let us flee! </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">4.14.6.58</span><span class="cts_passage">Éponine raised herself and listened; then she murmured:— </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">4.14.6.59</span><span class="cts_passage">“It is he.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">4.14.6.60</span><span class="cts_passage">And turning to Marius:— </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">4.14.6.61</span><span class="cts_passage">“My brother is here. He must not see me. He would scold me.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">4.14.6.62</span><span class="cts_passage">“Your brother?” inquired Marius, who was meditating in the most bitter and sorrowful depths of his heart on the duties to the Thénardiers which his father had bequeathed to him; “who is your brother?” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">4.14.6.63</span><span class="cts_passage">“That little fellow.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">4.14.6.64</span><span class="cts_passage">“The one who is singing?” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">4.14.6.65</span><span class="cts_passage">“Yes.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">4.14.6.66</span><span class="cts_passage">Marius made a movement. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">4.14.6.67</span><span class="cts_passage">“Oh! don’t go away,” said she, “it will not be long now.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">4.14.6.68</span><span class="cts_passage">She was sitting almost upright, but her voice was very low and broken by hiccoughs. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">4.14.6.69</span><span class="cts_passage">At intervals, the death rattle interrupted her. She put her face as near that of Marius as possible. She added with a strange expression:— </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">4.14.6.70</span><span class="cts_passage">“Listen, I do not wish to play you a trick. I have a letter in my pocket for you. I was told to put it in the post. I kept it. I did not want to have it reach you. But perhaps you will be angry with me for it when we meet again presently? Take your letter.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">4.14.6.71</span><span class="cts_passage">She grasped Marius’ hand convulsively with her pierced hand, but she no longer seemed to feel her sufferings. She put Marius’ hand in the pocket of her blouse. There, in fact, Marius felt a paper. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">4.14.6.72</span><span class="cts_passage">“Take it,” said she. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">4.14.6.73</span><span class="cts_passage">Marius took the letter. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">4.14.6.74</span><span class="cts_passage">She made a sign of satisfaction and contentment. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">4.14.6.75</span><span class="cts_passage">“Now, for my trouble, promise me—” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">4.14.6.76</span><span class="cts_passage">And she stopped. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">4.14.6.77</span><span class="cts_passage">“What?” asked Marius. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">4.14.6.78</span><span class="cts_passage">“Promise me!” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">4.14.6.79</span><span class="cts_passage">“I promise.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">4.14.6.80</span><span class="cts_passage">“Promise to give me a kiss on my brow when I am dead.—I shall feel it.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">4.14.6.81</span><span class="cts_passage">She dropped her head again on Marius’ knees, and her eyelids closed. He thought the poor soul had departed. Éponine remained motionless. All at once, at the very moment when Marius fancied her asleep forever, she slowly opened her eyes in which appeared the sombre profundity of death, and said to him in a tone whose sweetness seemed already to proceed from another world:— </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">4.14.6.82</span><span class="cts_passage">“And by the way, Monsieur Marius, I believe that I was a little bit in love with you.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">4.14.6.83</span><span class="cts_passage">She tried to smile once more and expired. </span></div></div>
