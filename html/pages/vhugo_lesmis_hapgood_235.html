<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.7.1</span><span class="cts_passage">Marius, with a load upon his breast, was on the point of descending from the species of observatory which he had improvised, when a sound attracted his attention and caused him to remain at his post. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.7.2</span><span class="cts_passage">The door of the attic had just burst open abruptly. The eldest girl made her appearance on the threshold. On her feet, she had large, coarse, men’s shoes, bespattered with mud, which had splashed even to her red ankles, and she was wrapped in an old mantle which hung in tatters. Marius had not seen it on her an hour previously, but she had probably deposited it at his door, in order that she might inspire the more pity, and had picked it up again on emerging. She entered, pushed the door to behind her, paused to take breath, for she was completely breathless, then exclaimed with an expression of triumph and joy:— </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.7.3</span><span class="cts_passage">“He is coming!” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.7.4</span><span class="cts_passage">The father turned his eyes towards her, the woman turned her head, the little sister did not stir. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.7.5</span><span class="cts_passage">“Who?” demanded her father. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.7.6</span><span class="cts_passage">“The gentleman!” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.7.7</span><span class="cts_passage">“The philanthropist?” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.7.8</span><span class="cts_passage">“Yes.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.7.9</span><span class="cts_passage">“From the church of Saint-Jacques?” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.7.10</span><span class="cts_passage">“Yes.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.7.11</span><span class="cts_passage">“That old fellow?” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.7.12</span><span class="cts_passage">“Yes.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.7.13</span><span class="cts_passage">“And he is coming?” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.7.14</span><span class="cts_passage">“He is following me.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.7.15</span><span class="cts_passage">“You are sure?” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.7.16</span><span class="cts_passage">“I am sure.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.7.17</span><span class="cts_passage">“There, truly, he is coming?” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.7.18</span><span class="cts_passage">“He is coming in a fiacre.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.7.19</span><span class="cts_passage">“In a fiacre. He is Rothschild.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.7.20</span><span class="cts_passage">The father rose. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.7.21</span><span class="cts_passage">“How are you sure? If he is coming in a fiacre, how is it that you arrive before him? You gave him our address at least? Did you tell him that it was the last door at the end of the corridor, on the right? If he only does not make a mistake! So you found him at the church? Did he read my letter? What did he say to you?” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.7.22</span><span class="cts_passage">“Ta, ta, ta,” said the girl, “how you do gallop on, my good man! See here: I entered the church, he was in his usual place, I made him a reverence, and I handed him the letter; he read it and said to me: ‘Where do you live, my child?’ I said: ‘Monsieur, I will show you.’ He said to me: ‘No, give me your address, my daughter has some purchases to make, I will take a carriage and reach your house at the same time that you do.’ I gave him the address. When I mentioned the house, he seemed surprised and hesitated for an instant, then he said: ‘Never mind, I will come.’ When the mass was finished, I watched him leave the church with his daughter, and I saw them enter a carriage. I certainly did tell him the last door in the corridor, on the right.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.7.23</span><span class="cts_passage">“And what makes you think that he will come?” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.7.24</span><span class="cts_passage">“I have just seen the fiacre turn into the Rue Petit-Banquier. That is what made me run so.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.7.25</span><span class="cts_passage">“How do you know that it was the same fiacre?” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.7.26</span><span class="cts_passage">“Because I took notice of the number, so there!” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.7.27</span><span class="cts_passage">“What was the number?” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.7.28</span><span class="cts_passage">“440.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.7.29</span><span class="cts_passage">“Good, you are a clever girl.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.7.30</span><span class="cts_passage">The girl stared boldly at her father, and showing the shoes which she had on her feet:— </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.7.31</span><span class="cts_passage">“A clever girl, possibly; but I tell you I won’t put these shoes on again, and that I won’t, for the sake of my health, in the first place, and for the sake of cleanliness, in the next. I don’t know anything more irritating than shoes that squelch, and go _ghi, ghi, ghi,_ the whole time. I prefer to go barefoot.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.7.32</span><span class="cts_passage">“You are right,” said her father, in a sweet tone which contrasted with the young girl’s rudeness, “but then, you will not be allowed to enter churches, for poor people must have shoes to do that. One cannot go barefoot to the good God,” he added bitterly. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.7.33</span><span class="cts_passage">Then, returning to the subject which absorbed him:— </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.7.34</span><span class="cts_passage">“So you are sure that he will come?” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.7.35</span><span class="cts_passage">“He is following on my heels,” said she. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.7.36</span><span class="cts_passage">The man started up. A sort of illumination appeared on his countenance. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.7.37</span><span class="cts_passage">“Wife!” he exclaimed, “you hear. Here is the philanthropist. Extinguish the fire.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.7.38</span><span class="cts_passage">The stupefied mother did not stir. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.7.39</span><span class="cts_passage">The father, with the agility of an acrobat, seized a broken-nosed jug which stood on the chimney, and flung the water on the brands. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.7.40</span><span class="cts_passage">Then, addressing his eldest daughter:— </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.7.41</span><span class="cts_passage">“Here you! Pull the straw off that chair!” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.7.42</span><span class="cts_passage">His daughter did not understand. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.7.43</span><span class="cts_passage">He seized the chair, and with one kick he rendered it seatless. His leg passed through it. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.7.44</span><span class="cts_passage">As he withdrew his leg, he asked his daughter:— </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.7.45</span><span class="cts_passage">“Is it cold?” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.7.46</span><span class="cts_passage">“Very cold. It is snowing.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.7.47</span><span class="cts_passage">The father turned towards the younger girl who sat on the bed near the window, and shouted to her in a thundering voice:— </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.7.48</span><span class="cts_passage">“Quick! get off that bed, you lazy thing! will you never do anything? Break a pane of glass!” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.7.49</span><span class="cts_passage">The little girl jumped off the bed with a shiver. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.7.50</span><span class="cts_passage">“Break a pane!” he repeated. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.7.51</span><span class="cts_passage">The child stood still in bewilderment. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.7.52</span><span class="cts_passage">“Do you hear me?” repeated her father, “I tell you to break a pane!” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.7.53</span><span class="cts_passage">The child, with a sort of terrified obedience, rose on tiptoe, and struck a pane with her fist. The glass broke and fell with a loud clatter. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.7.54</span><span class="cts_passage">“Good,” said the father. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.7.55</span><span class="cts_passage">He was grave and abrupt. His glance swept rapidly over all the crannies of the garret. One would have said that he was a general making the final preparation at the moment when the battle is on the point of beginning. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.7.56</span><span class="cts_passage">The mother, who had not said a word so far, now rose and demanded in a dull, slow, languid voice, whence her words seemed to emerge in a congealed state:— </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.7.57</span><span class="cts_passage">“What do you mean to do, my dear?” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.7.58</span><span class="cts_passage">“Get into bed,” replied the man. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.7.59</span><span class="cts_passage">His intonation admitted of no deliberation. The mother obeyed, and threw herself heavily on one of the pallets. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.7.60</span><span class="cts_passage">In the meantime, a sob became audible in one corner. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.7.61</span><span class="cts_passage">“What’s that?” cried the father. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.7.62</span><span class="cts_passage">The younger daughter exhibited her bleeding fist, without quitting the corner in which she was cowering. She had wounded herself while breaking the window; she went off, near her mother’s pallet and wept silently. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.7.63</span><span class="cts_passage">It was now the mother’s turn to start up and exclaim:— </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.7.64</span><span class="cts_passage">“Just see there! What follies you commit! She has cut herself breaking that pane for you!” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.7.65</span><span class="cts_passage">“So much the better!” said the man. “I foresaw that.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.7.66</span><span class="cts_passage">“What? So much the better?” retorted his wife. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.7.67</span><span class="cts_passage">“Peace!” replied the father, “I suppress the liberty of the press.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.7.68</span><span class="cts_passage">Then tearing the woman’s chemise which he was wearing, he made a strip of cloth with which he hastily swathed the little girl’s bleeding wrist. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.7.69</span><span class="cts_passage">That done, his eye fell with a satisfied expression on his torn chemise. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.7.70</span><span class="cts_passage">“And the chemise too,” said he, “this has a good appearance.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.7.71</span><span class="cts_passage">An icy breeze whistled through the window and entered the room. The outer mist penetrated thither and diffused itself like a whitish sheet of wadding vaguely spread by invisible fingers. Through the broken pane the snow could be seen falling. The snow promised by the Candlemas sun of the preceding day had actually come. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.7.72</span><span class="cts_passage">The father cast a glance about him as though to make sure that he had forgotten nothing. He seized an old shovel and spread ashes over the wet brands in such a manner as to entirely conceal them. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.7.73</span><span class="cts_passage">Then drawing himself up and leaning against the chimney-piece:— </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.7.74</span><span class="cts_passage">“Now,” said he, “we can receive the philanthropist.” </span></div></div>
