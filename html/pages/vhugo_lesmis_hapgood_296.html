<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">4.8.4.1</span><span class="cts_passage">The following day was the 3d of June, 1832, a date which it is necessary to indicate on account of the grave events which at that epoch hung on the horizon of Paris in the state of lightning-charged clouds. Marius, at nightfall, was pursuing the same road as on the preceding evening, with the same thoughts of delight in his heart, when he caught sight of Éponine approaching, through the trees of the boulevard. Two days in succession—this was too much. He turned hastily aside, quitted the boulevard, changed his course and went to the Rue Plumet through the Rue Monsieur. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">4.8.4.2</span><span class="cts_passage">This caused Éponine to follow him to the Rue Plumet, a thing which she had not yet done. Up to that time, she had contented herself with watching him on his passage along the boulevard without ever seeking to encounter him. It was only on the evening before that she had attempted to address him. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">4.8.4.3</span><span class="cts_passage">So Éponine followed him, without his suspecting the fact. She saw him displace the bar and slip into the garden. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">4.8.4.4</span><span class="cts_passage">She approached the railing, felt of the bars one after the other, and readily recognized the one which Marius had moved. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">4.8.4.5</span><span class="cts_passage">She murmured in a low voice and in gloomy accents:— </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">4.8.4.6</span><span class="cts_passage">“None of that, Lisette!” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">4.8.4.7</span><span class="cts_passage">She seated herself on the underpinning of the railing, close beside the bar, as though she were guarding it. It was precisely at the point where the railing touched the neighboring wall. There was a dim nook there, in which Éponine was entirely concealed. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">4.8.4.8</span><span class="cts_passage">She remained thus for more than an hour, without stirring and without breathing, a prey to her thoughts. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">4.8.4.9</span><span class="cts_passage">Towards ten o’clock in the evening, one of the two or three persons who passed through the Rue Plumet, an old, belated bourgeois who was making haste to escape from this deserted spot of evil repute, as he skirted the garden railings and reached the angle which it made with the wall, heard a dull and threatening voice saying:— </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">4.8.4.10</span><span class="cts_passage">“I’m no longer surprised that he comes here every evening.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">4.8.4.11</span><span class="cts_passage">The passer-by cast a glance around him, saw no one, dared not peer into the black niche, and was greatly alarmed. He redoubled his pace. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">4.8.4.12</span><span class="cts_passage">This passer-by had reason to make haste, for a very few instants later, six men, who were marching separately and at some distance from each other, along the wall, and who might have been taken for a gray patrol, entered the Rue Plumet. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">4.8.4.13</span><span class="cts_passage">The first to arrive at the garden railing halted, and waited for the others; a second later, all six were reunited. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">4.8.4.14</span><span class="cts_passage">These men began to talk in a low voice. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">4.8.4.15</span><span class="cts_passage">“This is the place,” said one of them. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">4.8.4.16</span><span class="cts_passage">“Is there a _cab_ [dog] in the garden?” asked another. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">4.8.4.17</span><span class="cts_passage">“I don’t know. In any case, I have fetched a ball that we’ll make him eat.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">4.8.4.18</span><span class="cts_passage">“Have you some putty to break the pane with?” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">4.8.4.19</span><span class="cts_passage">“Yes.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">4.8.4.20</span><span class="cts_passage">“The railing is old,” interpolated a fifth, who had the voice of a ventriloquist. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">4.8.4.21</span><span class="cts_passage">“So much the better,” said the second who had spoken. “It won’t screech under the saw, and it won’t be hard to cut.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">4.8.4.22</span><span class="cts_passage">The sixth, who had not yet opened his lips, now began to inspect the gate, as Éponine had done an hour earlier, grasping each bar in succession, and shaking them cautiously. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">4.8.4.23</span><span class="cts_passage">Thus he came to the bar which Marius had loosened. As he was on the point of grasping this bar, a hand emerged abruptly from the darkness, fell upon his arm; he felt himself vigorously thrust aside by a push in the middle of his breast, and a hoarse voice said to him, but not loudly:— </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">4.8.4.24</span><span class="cts_passage">“There’s a dog.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">4.8.4.25</span><span class="cts_passage">At the same moment, he perceived a pale girl standing before him. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">4.8.4.26</span><span class="cts_passage">The man underwent that shock which the unexpected always brings. He bristled up in hideous wise; nothing is so formidable to behold as ferocious beasts who are uneasy; their terrified air evokes terror. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">4.8.4.27</span><span class="cts_passage">He recoiled and stammered:— </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">4.8.4.28</span><span class="cts_passage">“What jade is this?” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">4.8.4.29</span><span class="cts_passage">“Your daughter.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">4.8.4.30</span><span class="cts_passage">It was, in fact, Éponine, who had addressed Thénardier. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">4.8.4.31</span><span class="cts_passage">At the apparition of Éponine, the other five, that is to say, Claquesous, Guelemer, Babet, Brujon, and Montparnasse had noiselessly drawn near, without precipitation, without uttering a word, with the sinister slowness peculiar to these men of the night. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">4.8.4.32</span><span class="cts_passage">Some indescribable but hideous tools were visible in their hands. Guelemer held one of those pairs of curved pincers which prowlers call _fanchons_. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">4.8.4.33</span><span class="cts_passage">“Ah, see here, what are you about there? What do you want with us? Are you crazy?” exclaimed Thénardier, as loudly as one can exclaim and still speak low; “what have you come here to hinder our work for?” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">4.8.4.34</span><span class="cts_passage">Éponine burst out laughing, and threw herself on his neck. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">4.8.4.35</span><span class="cts_passage">“I am here, little father, because I am here. Isn’t a person allowed to sit on the stones nowadays? It’s you who ought not to be here. What have you come here for, since it’s a biscuit? I told Magnon so. There’s nothing to be done here. But embrace me, my good little father! It’s a long time since I’ve seen you! So you’re out?” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">4.8.4.36</span><span class="cts_passage">Thénardier tried to disentangle himself from Éponine’s arms, and grumbled:— </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">4.8.4.37</span><span class="cts_passage">“That’s good. You’ve embraced me. Yes, I’m out. I’m not in. Now, get away with you.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">4.8.4.38</span><span class="cts_passage">But Éponine did not release her hold, and redoubled her caresses. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">4.8.4.39</span><span class="cts_passage">“But how did you manage it, little pa? You must have been very clever to get out of that. Tell me about it! And my mother? Where is mother? Tell me about mamma.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">4.8.4.40</span><span class="cts_passage">Thénardier replied:— </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">4.8.4.41</span><span class="cts_passage">“She’s well. I don’t know, let me alone, and be off, I tell you.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">4.8.4.42</span><span class="cts_passage">“I won’t go, so there now,” pouted Éponine like a spoiled child; “you send me off, and it’s four months since I saw you, and I’ve hardly had time to kiss you.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">4.8.4.43</span><span class="cts_passage">And she caught her father round the neck again. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">4.8.4.44</span><span class="cts_passage">“Come, now, this is stupid!” said Babet. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">4.8.4.45</span><span class="cts_passage">“Make haste!” said Guelemer, “the cops may pass.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">4.8.4.46</span><span class="cts_passage">The ventriloquist’s voice repeated his distich:— </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">4.8.4.47</span><span class="cts_passage">“Nous n’ sommes pas le jour de l’an, “This isn’t New Year’s day A bécoter papa, maman.” To peck at pa and ma.”  </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">4.8.4.48</span><span class="cts_passage">Éponine turned to the five ruffians. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">4.8.4.49</span><span class="cts_passage">“Why, it’s Monsieur Brujon. Good day, Monsieur Babet. Good day, Monsieur Claquesous. Don’t you know me, Monsieur Guelemer? How goes it, Montparnasse?” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">4.8.4.50</span><span class="cts_passage">“Yes, they know you!” ejaculated Thénardier. “But good day, good evening, sheer off! leave us alone!” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">4.8.4.51</span><span class="cts_passage">“It’s the hour for foxes, not for chickens,” said Montparnasse. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">4.8.4.52</span><span class="cts_passage">“You see the job we have on hand here,” added Babet. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">4.8.4.53</span><span class="cts_passage">Éponine caught Montparnasse’s hand. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">4.8.4.54</span><span class="cts_passage">“Take care,” said he, “you’ll cut yourself, I’ve a knife open.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">4.8.4.55</span><span class="cts_passage">“My little Montparnasse,” responded Éponine very gently, “you must have confidence in people. I am the daughter of my father, perhaps. Monsieur Babet, Monsieur Guelemer, I’m the person who was charged to investigate this matter.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">4.8.4.56</span><span class="cts_passage">It is remarkable that Éponine did not talk slang. That frightful tongue had become impossible to her since she had known Marius. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">4.8.4.57</span><span class="cts_passage">She pressed in her hand, small, bony, and feeble as that of a skeleton, Guelemer’s huge, coarse fingers, and continued:— </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">4.8.4.58</span><span class="cts_passage">“You know well that I’m no fool. Ordinarily, I am believed. I have rendered you service on various occasions. Well, I have made inquiries; you will expose yourselves to no purpose, you see. I swear to you that there is nothing in this house.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">4.8.4.59</span><span class="cts_passage">“There are lone women,” said Guelemer. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">4.8.4.60</span><span class="cts_passage">“No, the persons have moved away.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">4.8.4.61</span><span class="cts_passage">“The candles haven’t, anyway!” ejaculated Babet. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">4.8.4.62</span><span class="cts_passage">And he pointed out to Éponine, across the tops of the trees, a light which was wandering about in the mansard roof of the pavilion. It was Toussaint, who had stayed up to spread out some linen to dry. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">4.8.4.63</span><span class="cts_passage">Éponine made a final effort. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">4.8.4.64</span><span class="cts_passage">“Well,” said she, “they’re very poor folks, and it’s a hovel where there isn’t a sou.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">4.8.4.65</span><span class="cts_passage">“Go to the devil!” cried Thénardier. “When we’ve turned the house upside down and put the cellar at the top and the attic below, we’ll tell you what there is inside, and whether it’s francs or sous or half-farthings.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">4.8.4.66</span><span class="cts_passage">And he pushed her aside with the intention of entering. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">4.8.4.67</span><span class="cts_passage">“My good friend, Mr. Montparnasse,” said Éponine, “I entreat you, you are a good fellow, don’t enter.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">4.8.4.68</span><span class="cts_passage">“Take care, you’ll cut yourself,” replied Montparnasse. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">4.8.4.69</span><span class="cts_passage">Thénardier resumed in his decided tone:— </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">4.8.4.70</span><span class="cts_passage">“Decamp, my girl, and leave men to their own affairs!” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">4.8.4.71</span><span class="cts_passage">Éponine released Montparnasse’s hand, which she had grasped again, and said:— </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">4.8.4.72</span><span class="cts_passage">“So you mean to enter this house?” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">4.8.4.73</span><span class="cts_passage">“Rather!” grinned the ventriloquist. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">4.8.4.74</span><span class="cts_passage">Then she set her back against the gate, faced the six ruffians who were armed to the teeth, and to whom the night lent the visages of demons, and said in a firm, low voice:— </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">4.8.4.75</span><span class="cts_passage">“Well, I don’t mean that you shall.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">4.8.4.76</span><span class="cts_passage">They halted in amazement. The ventriloquist, however, finished his grin. She went on:— </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">4.8.4.77</span><span class="cts_passage">“Friends! Listen well. This is not what you want. Now I’m talking. In the first place, if you enter this garden, if you lay a hand on this gate, I’ll scream, I’ll beat on the door, I’ll rouse everybody, I’ll have the whole six of you seized, I’ll call the police.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">4.8.4.78</span><span class="cts_passage">“She’d do it, too,” said Thénardier in a low tone to Brujon and the ventriloquist. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">4.8.4.79</span><span class="cts_passage">She shook her head and added:— </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">4.8.4.80</span><span class="cts_passage">“Beginning with my father!” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">4.8.4.81</span><span class="cts_passage">Thénardier stepped nearer. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">4.8.4.82</span><span class="cts_passage">“Not so close, my good man!” said she. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">4.8.4.83</span><span class="cts_passage">He retreated, growling between his teeth:— </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">4.8.4.84</span><span class="cts_passage">“Why, what’s the matter with her?” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">4.8.4.85</span><span class="cts_passage">And he added:— </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">4.8.4.86</span><span class="cts_passage">“Bitch!” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">4.8.4.87</span><span class="cts_passage">She began to laugh in a terrible way:— </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">4.8.4.88</span><span class="cts_passage">“As you like, but you shall not enter here. I’m not the daughter of a dog, since I’m the daughter of a wolf. There are six of you, what matters that to me? You are men. Well, I’m a woman. You don’t frighten me. I tell you that you shan’t enter this house, because it doesn’t suit me. If you approach, I’ll bark. I told you, I’m the dog, and I don’t care a straw for you. Go your way, you bore me! Go where you please, but don’t come here, I forbid it! You can use your knives. I’ll use kicks; it’s all the same to me, come on!” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">4.8.4.89</span><span class="cts_passage">She advanced a pace nearer the ruffians, she was terrible, she burst out laughing:— </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">4.8.4.90</span><span class="cts_passage">“Pardine! I’m not afraid. I shall be hungry this summer, and I shall be cold this winter. Aren’t they ridiculous, these ninnies of men, to think they can scare a girl! What! Scare? Oh, yes, much! Because you have finical poppets of mistresses who hide under the bed when you put on a big voice, forsooth! I ain’t afraid of anything, that I ain’t!” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">4.8.4.91</span><span class="cts_passage">She fastened her intent gaze upon Thénardier and said:— </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">4.8.4.92</span><span class="cts_passage">“Not even of you, father!” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">4.8.4.93</span><span class="cts_passage">Then she continued, as she cast her blood-shot, spectre-like eyes upon the ruffians in turn:— </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">4.8.4.94</span><span class="cts_passage">“What do I care if I’m picked up to-morrow morning on the pavement of the Rue Plumet, killed by the blows of my father’s club, or whether I’m found a year from now in the nets at Saint-Cloud or the Isle of Swans in the midst of rotten old corks and drowned dogs?” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">4.8.4.95</span><span class="cts_passage">She was forced to pause; she was seized by a dry cough, her breath came from her weak and narrow chest like the death-rattle. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">4.8.4.96</span><span class="cts_passage">She resumed:— </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">4.8.4.97</span><span class="cts_passage">“I have only to cry out, and people will come, and then slap, bang! There are six of you; I represent the whole world.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">4.8.4.98</span><span class="cts_passage">Thénardier made a movement towards her. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">4.8.4.99</span><span class="cts_passage">“Don’t approach!” she cried. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">4.8.4.100</span><span class="cts_passage">He halted, and said gently:— </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">4.8.4.101</span><span class="cts_passage">“Well, no; I won’t approach, but don’t speak so loud. So you intend to hinder us in our work, my daughter? But we must earn our living all the same. Have you no longer any kind feeling for your father?” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">4.8.4.102</span><span class="cts_passage">“You bother me,” said Éponine. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">4.8.4.103</span><span class="cts_passage">“But we must live, we must eat—” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">4.8.4.104</span><span class="cts_passage">“Burst!” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">4.8.4.105</span><span class="cts_passage">So saying, she seated herself on the underpinning of the fence and hummed:— </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">4.8.4.106</span><span class="cts_passage">“Mon bras si dodu, “My arm so plump, Ma jambe bien faite My leg well formed, Et le temps perdu.” And time wasted.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">4.8.4.107</span><span class="cts_passage">She had set her elbow on her knee and her chin in her hand, and she swung her foot with an air of indifference. Her tattered gown permitted a view of her thin shoulder-blades. The neighboring street lantern illuminated her profile and her attitude. Nothing more resolute and more surprising could be seen. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">4.8.4.108</span><span class="cts_passage">The six rascals, speechless and gloomy at being held in check by a girl, retreated beneath the shadow cast by the lantern, and held counsel with furious and humiliated shrugs. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">4.8.4.109</span><span class="cts_passage">In the meantime she stared at them with a stern but peaceful air. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">4.8.4.110</span><span class="cts_passage">“There’s something the matter with her,” said Babet. “A reason. Is she in love with the dog? It’s a shame to miss this, anyway. Two women, an old fellow who lodges in the back-yard, and curtains that ain’t so bad at the windows. The old cove must be a Jew. I think the job’s a good one.” </span></div>
