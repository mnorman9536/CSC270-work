<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">1.5.6.1</span><span class="cts_passage">One morning M. Madeleine was passing through an unpaved alley of M. sur M.; he heard a noise, and saw a group some distance away. He approached. An old man named Father Fauchelevent had just fallen beneath his cart, his horse having tumbled down. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">1.5.6.2</span><span class="cts_passage">This Fauchelevent was one of the few enemies whom M. Madeleine had at that time. When Madeleine arrived in the neighborhood, Fauchelevent, an ex-notary and a peasant who was almost educated, had a business which was beginning to be in a bad way. Fauchelevent had seen this simple workman grow rich, while he, a lawyer, was being ruined. This had filled him with jealousy, and he had done all he could, on every occasion, to injure Madeleine. Then bankruptcy had come; and as the old man had nothing left but a cart and a horse, and neither family nor children, he had turned carter. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">1.5.6.3</span><span class="cts_passage">The horse had two broken legs and could not rise. The old man was caught in the wheels. The fall had been so unlucky that the whole weight of the vehicle rested on his breast. The cart was quite heavily laden. Father Fauchelevent was rattling in the throat in the most lamentable manner. They had tried, but in vain, to drag him out. An unmethodical effort, aid awkwardly given, a wrong shake, might kill him. It was impossible to disengage him otherwise than by lifting the vehicle off of him. Javert, who had come up at the moment of the accident, had sent for a jack-screw. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">1.5.6.4</span><span class="cts_passage">M. Madeleine arrived. People stood aside respectfully. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">1.5.6.5</span><span class="cts_passage">“Help!” cried old Fauchelevent. “Who will be good and save the old man?” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">1.5.6.6</span><span class="cts_passage">M. Madeleine turned towards those present:— </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">1.5.6.7</span><span class="cts_passage">“Is there a jack-screw to be had?” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">1.5.6.8</span><span class="cts_passage">“One has been sent for,” answered the peasant. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">1.5.6.9</span><span class="cts_passage">“How long will it take to get it?” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">1.5.6.10</span><span class="cts_passage">“They have gone for the nearest, to Flachot’s place, where there is a farrier; but it makes no difference; it will take a good quarter of an hour.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">1.5.6.11</span><span class="cts_passage">“A quarter of an hour!” exclaimed Madeleine. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">1.5.6.12</span><span class="cts_passage">It had rained on the preceding night; the soil was soaked. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">1.5.6.13</span><span class="cts_passage">The cart was sinking deeper into the earth every moment, and crushing the old carter’s breast more and more. It was evident that his ribs would be broken in five minutes more. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">1.5.6.14</span><span class="cts_passage">“It is impossible to wait another quarter of an hour,” said Madeleine to the peasants, who were staring at him. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">1.5.6.15</span><span class="cts_passage">“We must!” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">1.5.6.16</span><span class="cts_passage">“But it will be too late then! Don’t you see that the cart is sinking?” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">1.5.6.17</span><span class="cts_passage">“Well!” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">1.5.6.18</span><span class="cts_passage">“Listen,” resumed Madeleine; “there is still room enough under the cart to allow a man to crawl beneath it and raise it with his back. Only half a minute, and the poor man can be taken out. Is there any one here who has stout loins and heart? There are five louis d’or to be earned!” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">1.5.6.19</span><span class="cts_passage">Not a man in the group stirred. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">1.5.6.20</span><span class="cts_passage">“Ten louis,” said Madeleine. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">1.5.6.21</span><span class="cts_passage">The persons present dropped their eyes. One of them muttered: “A man would need to be devilish strong. And then he runs the risk of getting crushed!” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">1.5.6.22</span><span class="cts_passage">“Come,” began Madeleine again, “twenty louis.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">1.5.6.23</span><span class="cts_passage">The same silence. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">1.5.6.24</span><span class="cts_passage">“It is not the will which is lacking,” said a voice. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">1.5.6.25</span><span class="cts_passage">M. Madeleine turned round, and recognized Javert. He had not noticed him on his arrival. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">1.5.6.26</span><span class="cts_passage">Javert went on:— </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">1.5.6.27</span><span class="cts_passage">“It is strength. One would have to be a terrible man to do such a thing as lift a cart like that on his back.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">1.5.6.28</span><span class="cts_passage">Then, gazing fixedly at M. Madeleine, he went on, emphasizing every word that he uttered:— </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">1.5.6.29</span><span class="cts_passage">“Monsieur Madeleine, I have never known but one man capable of doing what you ask.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">1.5.6.30</span><span class="cts_passage">Madeleine shuddered. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">1.5.6.31</span><span class="cts_passage">Javert added, with an air of indifference, but without removing his eyes from Madeleine:— </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">1.5.6.32</span><span class="cts_passage">“He was a convict.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">1.5.6.33</span><span class="cts_passage">“Ah!” said Madeleine. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">1.5.6.34</span><span class="cts_passage">“In the galleys at Toulon.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">1.5.6.35</span><span class="cts_passage">Madeleine turned pale. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">1.5.6.36</span><span class="cts_passage">Meanwhile, the cart continued to sink slowly. Father Fauchelevent rattled in the throat, and shrieked:— </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">1.5.6.37</span><span class="cts_passage">“I am strangling! My ribs are breaking! a screw! something! Ah!” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">1.5.6.38</span><span class="cts_passage">Madeleine glanced about him. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">1.5.6.39</span><span class="cts_passage">“Is there, then, no one who wishes to earn twenty louis and save the life of this poor old man?” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">1.5.6.40</span><span class="cts_passage">No one stirred. Javert resumed:— </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">1.5.6.41</span><span class="cts_passage">“I have never known but one man who could take the place of a screw, and he was that convict.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">1.5.6.42</span><span class="cts_passage">“Ah! It is crushing me!” cried the old man. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">1.5.6.43</span><span class="cts_passage">Madeleine raised his head, met Javert’s falcon eye still fixed upon him, looked at the motionless peasants, and smiled sadly. Then, without saying a word, he fell on his knees, and before the crowd had even had time to utter a cry, he was underneath the vehicle. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">1.5.6.44</span><span class="cts_passage">A terrible moment of expectation and silence ensued. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">1.5.6.45</span><span class="cts_passage">They beheld Madeleine, almost flat on his stomach beneath that terrible weight, make two vain efforts to bring his knees and his elbows together. They shouted to him, “Father Madeleine, come out!” Old Fauchelevent himself said to him, “Monsieur Madeleine, go away! You see that I am fated to die! Leave me! You will get yourself crushed also!” Madeleine made no reply. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">1.5.6.46</span><span class="cts_passage">All the spectators were panting. The wheels had continued to sink, and it had become almost impossible for Madeleine to make his way from under the vehicle. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">1.5.6.47</span><span class="cts_passage">Suddenly the enormous mass was seen to quiver, the cart rose slowly, the wheels half emerged from the ruts. They heard a stifled voice crying, “Make haste! Help!” It was Madeleine, who had just made a final effort. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">1.5.6.48</span><span class="cts_passage">They rushed forwards. The devotion of a single man had given force and courage to all. The cart was raised by twenty arms. Old Fauchelevent was saved. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">1.5.6.49</span><span class="cts_passage">Madeleine rose. He was pale, though dripping with perspiration. His clothes were torn and covered with mud. All wept. The old man kissed his knees and called him the good God. As for him, he bore upon his countenance an indescribable expression of happy and celestial suffering, and he fixed his tranquil eye on Javert, who was still staring at him. </span></div></div>
