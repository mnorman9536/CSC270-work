			<div class="cts_corpus"><div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.6.9.head</span><span class="cts_passage">CHAPTER IX—ECLIPSE </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.6.9.1</span><span class="cts_passage">The reader has just seen how Marius discovered, or thought that he discovered, that _She_ was named Ursule. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.6.9.2</span><span class="cts_passage">Appetite grows with loving. To know that her name was Ursule was a great deal; it was very little. In three or four weeks, Marius had devoured this bliss. He wanted another. He wanted to know where she lived. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.6.9.3</span><span class="cts_passage">He had committed his first blunder, by falling into the ambush of the bench by the Gladiator. He had committed a second, by not remaining at the Luxembourg when M. Leblanc came thither alone. He now committed a third, and an immense one. He followed “Ursule.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.6.9.4</span><span class="cts_passage">She lived in the Rue de l’Ouest, in the most unfrequented spot, in a new, three-story house, of modest appearance. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.6.9.5</span><span class="cts_passage">From that moment forth, Marius added to his happiness of seeing her at the Luxembourg the happiness of following her home. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.6.9.6</span><span class="cts_passage">His hunger was increasing. He knew her first name, at least, a charming name, a genuine woman’s name; he knew where she lived; he wanted to know who she was. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.6.9.7</span><span class="cts_passage">One evening, after he had followed them to their dwelling, and had seen them disappear through the carriage gate, he entered in their train and said boldly to the porter:— </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.6.9.8</span><span class="cts_passage">“Is that the gentleman who lives on the first floor, who has just come in?” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.6.9.9</span><span class="cts_passage">“No,” replied the porter. “He is the gentleman on the third floor.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.6.9.10</span><span class="cts_passage">Another step gained. This success emboldened Marius. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.6.9.11</span><span class="cts_passage">“On the front?” he asked. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.6.9.12</span><span class="cts_passage">“Parbleu!” said the porter, “the house is only built on the street.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.6.9.13</span><span class="cts_passage">“And what is that gentleman’s business?” began Marius again. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.6.9.14</span><span class="cts_passage">“He is a gentleman of property, sir. A very kind man who does good to the unfortunate, though not rich himself.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.6.9.15</span><span class="cts_passage">“What is his name?” resumed Marius. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.6.9.16</span><span class="cts_passage">The porter raised his head and said:— </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.6.9.17</span><span class="cts_passage">“Are you a police spy, sir?” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.6.9.18</span><span class="cts_passage">Marius went off quite abashed, but delighted. He was getting on. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.6.9.19</span><span class="cts_passage">“Good,” thought he, “I know that her name is Ursule, that she is the daughter of a gentleman who lives on his income, and that she lives there, on the third floor, in the Rue de l’Ouest.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.6.9.20</span><span class="cts_passage">On the following day, M. Leblanc and his daughter made only a very brief stay in the Luxembourg; they went away while it was still broad daylight. Marius followed them to the Rue de l’Ouest, as he had taken up the habit of doing. On arriving at the carriage entrance M. Leblanc made his daughter pass in first, then paused, before crossing the threshold, and stared intently at Marius. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.6.9.21</span><span class="cts_passage">On the next day they did not come to the Luxembourg. Marius waited for them all day in vain. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.6.9.22</span><span class="cts_passage">At nightfall, he went to the Rue de l’Ouest, and saw a light in the windows of the third story. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.6.9.23</span><span class="cts_passage">He walked about beneath the windows until the light was extinguished. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.6.9.24</span><span class="cts_passage">The next day, no one at the Luxembourg. Marius waited all day, then went and did sentinel duty under their windows. This carried him on to ten o’clock in the evening. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.6.9.25</span><span class="cts_passage">His dinner took care of itself. Fever nourishes the sick man, and love the lover. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.6.9.26</span><span class="cts_passage">He spent a week in this manner. M. Leblanc no longer appeared at the Luxembourg. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.6.9.27</span><span class="cts_passage">Marius indulged in melancholy conjectures; he dared not watch the porte-cochère during the day; he contented himself with going at night to gaze upon the red light of the windows. At times he saw shadows flit across them, and his heart began to beat. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.6.9.28</span><span class="cts_passage">On the eighth day, when he arrived under the windows, there was no light in them. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.6.9.29</span><span class="cts_passage">“Hello!” he said, “the lamp is not lighted yet. But it is dark. Can they have gone out?” He waited until ten o’clock. Until midnight. Until one in the morning. Not a light appeared in the windows of the third story, and no one entered the house. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.6.9.30</span><span class="cts_passage">He went away in a very gloomy frame of mind. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.6.9.31</span><span class="cts_passage">On the morrow,—for he only existed from morrow to morrow, there was, so to speak, no to-day for him,—on the morrow, he found no one at the Luxembourg; he had expected this. At dusk, he went to the house. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.6.9.32</span><span class="cts_passage">No light in the windows; the shades were drawn; the third floor was totally dark. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.6.9.33</span><span class="cts_passage">Marius rapped at the porte-cochère, entered, and said to the porter:— </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.6.9.34</span><span class="cts_passage">“The gentleman on the third floor?” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.6.9.35</span><span class="cts_passage">“Has moved away,” replied the porter. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.6.9.36</span><span class="cts_passage">Marius reeled and said feebly:— </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.6.9.37</span><span class="cts_passage">“How long ago?” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.6.9.38</span><span class="cts_passage">“Yesterday.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.6.9.39</span><span class="cts_passage">“Where is he living now?” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.6.9.40</span><span class="cts_passage">“I don’t know anything about it.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.6.9.41</span><span class="cts_passage">“So he has not left his new address?” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.6.9.42</span><span class="cts_passage">“No.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.6.9.43</span><span class="cts_passage">And the porter, raising his eyes, recognized Marius. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.6.9.44</span><span class="cts_passage">“Come! So it’s you!” said he; “but you are decidedly a spy then?” </span></div></div>
