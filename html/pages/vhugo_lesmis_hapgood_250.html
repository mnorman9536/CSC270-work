<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.22.1</span><span class="cts_passage">On the day following that on which these events took place in the house on the Boulevard de l’Hôpital, a child, who seemed to be coming from the direction of the bridge of Austerlitz, was ascending the side-alley on the right in the direction of the Barrière de Fontainebleau. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.22.2</span><span class="cts_passage">Night had fully come. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.22.3</span><span class="cts_passage">This lad was pale, thin, clad in rags, with linen trousers in the month of February, and was singing at the top of his voice. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.22.4</span><span class="cts_passage">At the corner of the Rue du Petit-Banquier, a bent old woman was rummaging in a heap of refuse by the light of a street lantern; the child jostled her as he passed, then recoiled, exclaiming:— </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.22.5</span><span class="cts_passage">“Hello! And I took it for an enormous, enormous dog!” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.22.6</span><span class="cts_passage">He pronounced the word _enormous_ the second time with a jeering swell of the voice which might be tolerably well represented by capitals: “an enormous, ENORMOUS dog.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.22.7</span><span class="cts_passage">The old woman straightened herself up in a fury. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.22.8</span><span class="cts_passage">“Nasty brat!” she grumbled. “If I hadn’t been bending over, I know well where I would have planted my foot on you.” </span></div>

<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.22.10</span><span class="cts_passage">“Kisss! kisss!” he cried. “After that, I don’t think I was mistaken!” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.22.11</span><span class="cts_passage">The old woman, choking with indignation, now rose completely upright, and the red gleam of the lantern fully lighted up her livid face, all hollowed into angles and wrinkles, with crow’s-feet meeting the corners of her mouth. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.22.12</span><span class="cts_passage">Her body was lost in the darkness, and only her head was visible. One would have pronounced her a mask of Decrepitude carved out by a light from the night. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.22.13</span><span class="cts_passage">The boy surveyed her. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.22.14</span><span class="cts_passage">“Madame,” said he, “does not possess that style of beauty which pleases me.” </span></div>

<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.22.16</span><span class="cts_passage">“Le roi Coupdesabot S’en allait à la chasse, À la chasse aux corbeaux—” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.22.17</span><span class="cts_passage">At the end of these three lines he paused. He had arrived in front of No. 50-52, and finding the door fastened, he began to assault it with resounding and heroic kicks, which betrayed rather the man’s shoes that he was wearing than the child’s feet which he owned. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.22.18</span><span class="cts_passage">In the meanwhile, the very old woman whom he had encountered at the corner of the Rue du Petit-Banquier hastened up behind him, uttering clamorous cries and indulging in lavish and exaggerated gestures. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.22.19</span><span class="cts_passage">“What’s this? What’s this? Lord God! He’s battering the door down! He’s knocking the house down.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.22.20</span><span class="cts_passage">The kicks continued. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.22.21</span><span class="cts_passage">The old woman strained her lungs. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.22.22</span><span class="cts_passage">“Is that the way buildings are treated nowadays?” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.22.23</span><span class="cts_passage">All at once she paused. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.22.24</span><span class="cts_passage">She had recognized the gamin. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.22.25</span><span class="cts_passage">“What! so it’s that imp!” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.22.26</span><span class="cts_passage">“Why, it’s the old lady,” said the lad. “Good day, Bougonmuche. I have come to see my ancestors.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.22.27</span><span class="cts_passage">The old woman retorted with a composite grimace, and a wonderful improvisation of hatred taking advantage of feebleness and ugliness, which was, unfortunately, wasted in the dark:— </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.22.28</span><span class="cts_passage">“There’s no one here.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.22.29</span><span class="cts_passage">“Bah!” retorted the boy, “where’s my father?” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.22.30</span><span class="cts_passage">“At La Force.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.22.31</span><span class="cts_passage">“Come, now! And my mother?” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.22.32</span><span class="cts_passage">“At Saint-Lazare.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.22.33</span><span class="cts_passage">“Well! And my sisters?” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.22.34</span><span class="cts_passage">“At the Madelonettes.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.22.35</span><span class="cts_passage">The lad scratched his head behind his ear, stared at Ma’am Bougon, and said:— </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.22.36</span><span class="cts_passage">“Ah!” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.22.37</span><span class="cts_passage">Then he executed a pirouette on his heel; a moment later, the old woman, who had remained on the door-step, heard him singing in his clear, young voice, as he plunged under the black elm-trees, in the wintry wind:— </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.22.38</span><span class="cts_passage">“Le roi Coupdesabot S’en allait à la chasse, À la chasse aux corbeaux, Monté sur deux échasses. Quand on passait dessous, On lui payait deux sous."31 </span></div>
