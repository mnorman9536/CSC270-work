<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">4.11.2.1</span><span class="cts_passage">The brandishing of a triggerless pistol, grasped in one’s hand in the open street, is so much of a public function that Gavroche felt his fervor increasing with every moment. Amid the scraps of the Marseillaise which he was singing, he shouted:— </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">4.11.2.2</span><span class="cts_passage">“All goes well. I suffer a great deal in my left paw, I’m all broken up with rheumatism, but I’m satisfied, citizens. All that the bourgeois have to do is to bear themselves well, I’ll sneeze them out subversive couplets. What are the police spies? Dogs. And I’d just like to have one of them at the end of my pistol. I’m just from the boulevard, my friends. It’s getting hot there, it’s getting into a little boil, it’s simmering. It’s time to skim the pot. Forward march, men! Let an impure blood inundate the furrows! I give my days to my country, I shall never see my concubine more, Nini, finished, yes, Nini? But never mind! Long live joy! Let’s fight, crebleu! I’ve had enough of despotism.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">4.11.2.3</span><span class="cts_passage">At that moment, the horse of a lancer of the National Guard having fallen, Gavroche laid his pistol on the pavement, and picked up the man, then he assisted in raising the horse. After which he picked up his pistol and resumed his way. In the Rue de Thorigny, all was peace and silence. This apathy, peculiar to the Marais, presented a contrast with the vast surrounding uproar. Four gossips were chatting in a doorway. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">4.11.2.4</span><span class="cts_passage">Scotland has trios of witches, Paris has quartettes of old gossiping hags; and the “Thou shalt be King” could be quite as mournfully hurled at Bonaparte in the Carrefour Baudoyer as at Macbeth on the heath of Armuyr. The croak would be almost identical. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">4.11.2.5</span><span class="cts_passage">The gossips of the Rue de Thorigny busied themselves only with their own concerns. Three of them were portresses, and the fourth was a rag-picker with her basket on her back. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">4.11.2.6</span><span class="cts_passage">All four of them seemed to be standing at the four corners of old age, which are decrepitude, decay, ruin, and sadness. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">4.11.2.7</span><span class="cts_passage">The rag-picker was humble. In this open-air society, it is the rag-picker who salutes and the portress who patronizes. This is caused by the corner for refuse, which is fat or lean, according to the will of the portresses, and after the fancy of the one who makes the heap. There may be kindness in the broom. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">4.11.2.8</span><span class="cts_passage">This rag-picker was a grateful creature, and she smiled, with what a smile! on the three portresses. Things of this nature were said:— </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">4.11.2.9</span><span class="cts_passage">“Ah, by the way, is your cat still cross?” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">4.11.2.10</span><span class="cts_passage">“Good gracious, cats are naturally the enemies of dogs, you know. It’s the dogs who complain.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">4.11.2.11</span><span class="cts_passage">“And people also.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">4.11.2.12</span><span class="cts_passage">“But the fleas from a cat don’t go after people.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">4.11.2.13</span><span class="cts_passage">“That’s not the trouble, dogs are dangerous. I remember one year when there were so many dogs that it was necessary to put it in the newspapers. That was at the time when there were at the Tuileries great sheep that drew the little carriage of the King of Rome. Do you remember the King of Rome?” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">4.11.2.14</span><span class="cts_passage">“I liked the Duc de Bordeau better.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">4.11.2.15</span><span class="cts_passage">“I knew Louis XVIII. I prefer Louis XVIII.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">4.11.2.16</span><span class="cts_passage">“Meat is awfully dear, isn’t it, Mother Patagon?” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">4.11.2.17</span><span class="cts_passage">“Ah! don’t mention it, the butcher’s shop is a horror. A horrible horror—one can’t afford anything but the poor cuts nowadays.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">4.11.2.18</span><span class="cts_passage">Here the rag-picker interposed:— </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">4.11.2.19</span><span class="cts_passage">“Ladies, business is dull. The refuse heaps are miserable. No one throws anything away any more. They eat everything.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">4.11.2.20</span><span class="cts_passage">“There are poorer people than you, la Vargoulême.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">4.11.2.21</span><span class="cts_passage">“Ah, that’s true,” replied the rag-picker, with deference, “I have a profession.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">4.11.2.22</span><span class="cts_passage">A pause succeeded, and the rag-picker, yielding to that necessity for boasting which lies at the bottom of man, added:— </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">4.11.2.23</span><span class="cts_passage">“In the morning, on my return home, I pick over my basket, I sort my things. This makes heaps in my room. I put the rags in a basket, the cores and stalks in a bucket, the linen in my cupboard, the woollen stuff in my commode, the old papers in the corner of the window, the things that are good to eat in my bowl, the bits of glass in my fireplace, the old shoes behind my door, and the bones under my bed.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">4.11.2.24</span><span class="cts_passage">Gavroche had stopped behind her and was listening. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">4.11.2.25</span><span class="cts_passage">“Old ladies,” said he, “what do you mean by talking politics?” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">4.11.2.26</span><span class="cts_passage">He was assailed by a broadside, composed of a quadruple howl. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">4.11.2.27</span><span class="cts_passage">“Here’s another rascal.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">4.11.2.28</span><span class="cts_passage">“What’s that he’s got in his paddle? A pistol?” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">4.11.2.29</span><span class="cts_passage">“Well, I’d like to know what sort of a beggar’s brat this is?” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">4.11.2.30</span><span class="cts_passage">“That sort of animal is never easy unless he’s overturning the authorities.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">4.11.2.31</span><span class="cts_passage">Gavroche disdainfully contented himself, by way of reprisal, with elevating the tip of his nose with his thumb and opening his hand wide. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">4.11.2.32</span><span class="cts_passage">The rag-picker cried:— </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">4.11.2.33</span><span class="cts_passage">“You malicious, bare-pawed little wretch!” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">4.11.2.34</span><span class="cts_passage">The one who answered to the name of Patagon clapped her hands together in horror. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">4.11.2.35</span><span class="cts_passage">“There’s going to be evil doings, that’s certain. The errand-boy next door has a little pointed beard, I have seen him pass every day with a young person in a pink bonnet on his arm; to-day I saw him pass, and he had a gun on his arm. Mame Bacheux says, that last week there was a revolution at—at—at—where’s the calf!—at Pontoise. And then, there you see him, that horrid scamp, with his pistol! It seems that the Célestins are full of pistols. What do you suppose the Government can do with good-for-nothings who don’t know how to do anything but contrive ways of upsetting the world, when we had just begun to get a little quiet after all the misfortunes that have happened, good Lord! to that poor queen whom I saw pass in the tumbril! And all this is going to make tobacco dearer. It’s infamous! And I shall certainly go to see him beheaded on the guillotine, the wretch!” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">4.11.2.36</span><span class="cts_passage">“You’ve got the sniffles, old lady,” said Gavroche. “Blow your promontory.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">4.11.2.37</span><span class="cts_passage">And he passed on. When he was in the Rue Pavée, the rag-picker occurred to his mind, and he indulged in this soliloquy:— </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">4.11.2.38</span><span class="cts_passage">“You’re in the wrong to insult the revolutionists, Mother Dust-Heap-Corner. This pistol is in your interests. It’s so that you may have more good things to eat in your basket.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">4.11.2.39</span><span class="cts_passage">All at once, he heard a shout behind him; it was the portress Patagon who had followed him, and who was shaking her fist at him in the distance and crying:— </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">4.11.2.40</span><span class="cts_passage">“You’re nothing but a bastard.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">4.11.2.41</span><span class="cts_passage">“Oh! Come now,” said Gavroche, “I don’t care a brass farthing for that!” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">4.11.2.42</span><span class="cts_passage">Shortly afterwards, he passed the Hotel Lamoignon. There he uttered this appeal:— </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">4.11.2.43</span><span class="cts_passage">“Forward march to the battle!” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">4.11.2.44</span><span class="cts_passage">And he was seized with a fit of melancholy. He gazed at his pistol with an air of reproach which seemed an attempt to appease it:— </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">4.11.2.45</span><span class="cts_passage">“I’m going off,” said he, “but you won’t go off!” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">4.11.2.46</span><span class="cts_passage">One dog may distract the attention from another dog.45 A very gaunt poodle came along at the moment. Gavroche felt compassion for him. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">4.11.2.47</span><span class="cts_passage">“My poor doggy,” said he, “you must have gone and swallowed a cask, for all the hoops are visible.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">4.11.2.48</span><span class="cts_passage">Then he directed his course towards l’Orme-Saint-Gervais. </span></div></div>
