<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">2.7.7.1</span><span class="cts_passage">History and philosophy have eternal duties, which are, at the same time, simple duties; to combat Caiphas the High-priest, Draco the Lawgiver, Trimalcion the Legislator, Tiberius the Emperor; this is clear, direct, and limpid, and offers no obscurity. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">2.7.7.2</span><span class="cts_passage">But the right to live apart, even with its inconveniences and its abuses, insists on being stated and taken into account. Cenobitism is a human problem. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">2.7.7.3</span><span class="cts_passage">When one speaks of convents, those abodes of error, but of innocence, of aberration but of good-will, of ignorance but of devotion, of torture but of martyrdom, it always becomes necessary to say either yes or no. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">2.7.7.4</span><span class="cts_passage">A convent is a contradiction. Its object, salvation; its means thereto, sacrifice. The convent is supreme egoism having for its result supreme abnegation. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">2.7.7.5</span><span class="cts_passage">To abdicate with the object of reigning seems to be the device of monasticism. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">2.7.7.6</span><span class="cts_passage">In the cloister, one suffers in order to enjoy. One draws a bill of exchange on death. One discounts in terrestrial gloom celestial light. In the cloister, hell is accepted in advance as a post obit on paradise. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">2.7.7.7</span><span class="cts_passage">The taking of the veil or the frock is a suicide paid for with eternity. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">2.7.7.8</span><span class="cts_passage">It does not seem to us, that on such a subject mockery is permissible. All about it is serious, the good as well as the bad. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">2.7.7.9</span><span class="cts_passage">The just man frowns, but never smiles with a malicious sneer. We understand wrath, but not malice. </span></div></div>
