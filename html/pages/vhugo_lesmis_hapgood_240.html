<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.12.1</span><span class="cts_passage">Nothing in the aspect of the family was altered, except that the wife and daughters had levied on the package and put on woollen stockings and jackets. Two new blankets were thrown across the two beds. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.12.2</span><span class="cts_passage">Jondrette had evidently just returned. He still had the breathlessness of out of doors. His daughters were seated on the floor near the fireplace, the elder engaged in dressing the younger’s wounded hand. His wife had sunk back on the bed near the fireplace, with a face indicative of astonishment. Jondrette was pacing up and down the garret with long strides. His eyes were extraordinary. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.12.3</span><span class="cts_passage">The woman, who seemed timid and overwhelmed with stupor in the presence of her husband, turned to say:— </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.12.4</span><span class="cts_passage">“What, really? You are sure?” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.12.5</span><span class="cts_passage">“Sure! Eight years have passed! But I recognize him! Ah! I recognize him. I knew him at once! What! Didn’t it force itself on you?” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.12.6</span><span class="cts_passage">“No.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.12.7</span><span class="cts_passage">“But I told you: ‘Pay attention!’ Why, it is his figure, it is his face, only older,—there are people who do not grow old, I don’t know how they manage it,—it is the very sound of his voice. He is better dressed, that is all! Ah! you mysterious old devil, I’ve got you, that I have!” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.12.8</span><span class="cts_passage">He paused, and said to his daughters:— </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.12.9</span><span class="cts_passage">“Get out of here, you!—It’s queer that it didn’t strike you!” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.12.10</span><span class="cts_passage">They arose to obey. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.12.11</span><span class="cts_passage">The mother stammered:— </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.12.12</span><span class="cts_passage">“With her injured hand.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.12.13</span><span class="cts_passage">“The air will do it good,” said Jondrette. “Be off.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.12.14</span><span class="cts_passage">It was plain that this man was of the sort to whom no one offers to reply. The two girls departed. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.12.15</span><span class="cts_passage">At the moment when they were about to pass through the door, the father detained the elder by the arm, and said to her with a peculiar accent:— </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.12.16</span><span class="cts_passage">“You will be here at five o’clock precisely. Both of you. I shall need you.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.12.17</span><span class="cts_passage">Marius redoubled his attention. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.12.18</span><span class="cts_passage">On being left alone with his wife, Jondrette began to pace the room again, and made the tour of it two or three times in silence. Then he spent several minutes in tucking the lower part of the woman’s chemise which he wore into his trousers. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.12.19</span><span class="cts_passage">All at once, he turned to the female Jondrette, folded his arms and exclaimed:— </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.12.20</span><span class="cts_passage">“And would you like to have me tell you something? The young lady—” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.12.21</span><span class="cts_passage">“Well, what?” retorted his wife, “the young lady?” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.12.22</span><span class="cts_passage">Marius could not doubt that it was really she of whom they were speaking. He listened with ardent anxiety. His whole life was in his ears. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.12.23</span><span class="cts_passage">But Jondrette had bent over and spoke to his wife in a whisper. Then he straightened himself up and concluded aloud:— </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.12.24</span><span class="cts_passage">“It is she!” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.12.25</span><span class="cts_passage">“That one?” said his wife. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.12.26</span><span class="cts_passage">“That very one,” said the husband. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.12.27</span><span class="cts_passage">No expression can reproduce the significance of the mother’s words. Surprise, rage, hate, wrath, were mingled and combined in one monstrous intonation. The pronunciation of a few words, the name, no doubt, which her husband had whispered in her ear, had sufficed to rouse this huge, somnolent woman, and from being repulsive she became terrible. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.12.28</span><span class="cts_passage">“It is not possible!” she cried. “When I think that my daughters are going barefoot, and have not a gown to their backs! What! A satin pelisse, a velvet bonnet, boots, and everything; more than two hundred francs’ worth of clothes! so that one would think she was a lady! No, you are mistaken! Why, in the first place, the other was hideous, and this one is not so bad-looking! She really is not bad-looking! It can’t be she!” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.12.29</span><span class="cts_passage">“I tell you that it is she. You will see.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.12.30</span><span class="cts_passage">At this absolute assertion, the Jondrette woman raised her large, red, blonde face and stared at the ceiling with a horrible expression. At that moment, she seemed to Marius even more to be feared than her husband. She was a sow with the look of a tigress. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.12.31</span><span class="cts_passage">“What!” she resumed, “that horrible, beautiful young lady, who gazed at my daughters with an air of pity,—she is that beggar brat! Oh! I should like to kick her stomach in for her!” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.12.32</span><span class="cts_passage">She sprang off of the bed, and remained standing for a moment, her hair in disorder, her nostrils dilating, her mouth half open, her fists clenched and drawn back. Then she fell back on the bed once more. The man paced to and fro and paid no attention to his female. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.12.33</span><span class="cts_passage">After a silence lasting several minutes, he approached the female Jondrette, and halted in front of her, with folded arms, as he had done a moment before:— </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.12.34</span><span class="cts_passage">“And shall I tell you another thing?” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.12.35</span><span class="cts_passage">“What is it?” she asked. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.12.36</span><span class="cts_passage">He answered in a low, curt voice:— </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.12.37</span><span class="cts_passage">“My fortune is made.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.12.38</span><span class="cts_passage">The woman stared at him with the look that signifies: “Is the person who is addressing me on the point of going mad?” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.12.39</span><span class="cts_passage">He went on:— </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.12.40</span><span class="cts_passage">“Thunder! It was not so very long ago that I was a parishioner of the parish of die-of-hunger-if-you-have-a-fire,-die-of-cold-if-you-have-bread! I have had enough of misery! my share and other people’s share! I am not joking any longer, I don’t find it comic any more, I’ve had enough of puns, good God! no more farces, Eternal Father! I want to eat till I am full, I want to drink my fill! to gormandize! to sleep! to do nothing! I want to have my turn, so I do, come now! before I die! I want to be a bit of a millionnaire!” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.12.41</span><span class="cts_passage">He took a turn round the hovel, and added:— </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.12.42</span><span class="cts_passage">“Like other people.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.12.43</span><span class="cts_passage">“What do you mean by that?” asked the woman. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.12.44</span><span class="cts_passage">He shook his head, winked, screwed up one eye, and raised his voice like a medical professor who is about to make a demonstration:— </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.12.45</span><span class="cts_passage">“What do I mean by that? Listen!” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.12.46</span><span class="cts_passage">“Hush!” muttered the woman, “not so loud! These are matters which must not be overheard.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.12.47</span><span class="cts_passage">“Bah! Who’s here? Our neighbor? I saw him go out a little while ago. Besides, he doesn’t listen, the big booby. And I tell you that I saw him go out.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.12.48</span><span class="cts_passage">Nevertheless, by a sort of instinct, Jondrette lowered his voice, although not sufficiently to prevent Marius hearing his words. One favorable circumstance, which enabled Marius not to lose a word of this conversation was the falling snow which deadened the sound of vehicles on the boulevard. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.12.49</span><span class="cts_passage">This is what Marius heard:— </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.12.50</span><span class="cts_passage">“Listen carefully. The Crœsus is caught, or as good as caught! That’s all settled already. Everything is arranged. I have seen some people. He will come here this evening at six o’clock. To bring sixty francs, the rascal! Did you notice how I played that game on him, my sixty francs, my landlord, my fourth of February? I don’t even owe for one quarter! Isn’t he a fool! So he will come at six o’clock! That’s the hour when our neighbor goes to his dinner. Mother Bougon is off washing dishes in the city. There’s not a soul in the house. The neighbor never comes home until eleven o’clock. The children shall stand on watch. You shall help us. He will give in.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.12.51</span><span class="cts_passage">“And what if he does not give in?” demanded his wife. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.12.52</span><span class="cts_passage">Jondrette made a sinister gesture, and said:— </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.12.53</span><span class="cts_passage">“We’ll fix him.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.12.54</span><span class="cts_passage">And he burst out laughing. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.12.55</span><span class="cts_passage">This was the first time Marius had seen him laugh. The laugh was cold and sweet, and provoked a shudder. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.12.56</span><span class="cts_passage">Jondrette opened a cupboard near the fireplace, and drew from it an old cap, which he placed on his head, after brushing it with his sleeve. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.12.57</span><span class="cts_passage">“Now,” said he, “I’m going out. I have some more people that I must see. Good ones. You’ll see how well the whole thing will work. I shall be away as short a time as possible, it’s a fine stroke of business, do you look after the house.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.12.58</span><span class="cts_passage">And with both fists thrust into the pockets of his trousers, he stood for a moment in thought, then exclaimed:— </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.12.59</span><span class="cts_passage">“Do you know, it’s mighty lucky, by the way, that he didn’t recognize me! If he had recognized me on his side, he would not have come back again. He would have slipped through our fingers! It was my beard that saved us! my romantic beard! my pretty little romantic beard!” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.12.60</span><span class="cts_passage">And again he broke into a laugh. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.12.61</span><span class="cts_passage">He stepped to the window. The snow was still falling, and streaking the gray of the sky. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.12.62</span><span class="cts_passage">“What beastly weather!” said he. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.12.63</span><span class="cts_passage">Then lapping his overcoat across his breast:— </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.12.64</span><span class="cts_passage">“This rind is too large for me. Never mind,” he added, “he did a devilish good thing in leaving it for me, the old scoundrel! If it hadn’t been for that, I couldn’t have gone out, and everything would have gone wrong! What small points things hang on, anyway!” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.12.65</span><span class="cts_passage">And pulling his cap down over his eyes, he quitted the room. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.12.66</span><span class="cts_passage">He had barely had time to take half a dozen steps from the door, when the door opened again, and his savage but intelligent face made its appearance once more in the opening. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.12.67</span><span class="cts_passage">“I came near forgetting,” said he. “You are to have a brazier of charcoal ready.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.12.68</span><span class="cts_passage">And he flung into his wife’s apron the five-franc piece which the “philanthropist” had left with him. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.12.69</span><span class="cts_passage">“A brazier of charcoal?” asked his wife. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.12.70</span><span class="cts_passage">“Yes.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.12.71</span><span class="cts_passage">“How many bushels?” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.12.72</span><span class="cts_passage">“Two good ones.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.12.73</span><span class="cts_passage">“That will come to thirty sous. With the rest I will buy something for dinner.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.12.74</span><span class="cts_passage">“The devil, no.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.12.75</span><span class="cts_passage">“Why?” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.12.76</span><span class="cts_passage">“Don’t go and spend the hundred-sou piece.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.12.77</span><span class="cts_passage">“Why?” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.12.78</span><span class="cts_passage">“Because I shall have to buy something, too.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.12.79</span><span class="cts_passage">“What?” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.12.80</span><span class="cts_passage">“Something.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.12.81</span><span class="cts_passage">“How much shall you need?” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.12.82</span><span class="cts_passage">“Whereabouts in the neighborhood is there an ironmonger’s shop?” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.12.83</span><span class="cts_passage">“Rue Mouffetard.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.12.84</span><span class="cts_passage">“Ah! yes, at the corner of a street; I can see the shop.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.12.85</span><span class="cts_passage">“But tell me how much you will need for what you have to purchase?” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.12.86</span><span class="cts_passage">“Fifty sous—three francs.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.12.87</span><span class="cts_passage">“There won’t be much left for dinner.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.12.88</span><span class="cts_passage">“Eating is not the point to-day. There’s something better to be done.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.12.89</span><span class="cts_passage">“That’s enough, my jewel.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.12.90</span><span class="cts_passage">At this word from his wife, Jondrette closed the door again, and this time, Marius heard his step die away in the corridor of the hovel, and descend the staircase rapidly. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.12.91</span><span class="cts_passage">At that moment, one o’clock struck from the church of Saint-Médard. </span></div></div>
