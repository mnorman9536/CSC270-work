<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">4.14.1.1</span><span class="cts_passage">As yet, nothing had come. Ten o’clock had sounded from Saint-Merry. Enjolras and Combeferre had gone and seated themselves, carbines in hand, near the outlet of the grand barricade. They no longer addressed each other, they listened, seeking to catch even the faintest and most distant sound of marching. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">4.14.1.2</span><span class="cts_passage">Suddenly, in the midst of the dismal calm, a clear, gay, young voice, which seemed to come from the Rue Saint-Denis, rose and began to sing distinctly, to the old popular air of “By the Light of the Moon,” this bit of poetry, terminated by a cry like the crow of a cock:— </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">4.14.1.3</span><span class="cts_passage">Mon nez est en larmes, Mon ami Bugeaud, Prête moi tes gendarmes Pour leur dire un mot. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">4.14.1.4</span><span class="cts_passage">En capote bleue, La poule au shako, Voici la banlieue! Co-cocorico!54 </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">4.14.1.5</span><span class="cts_passage">They pressed each other’s hands. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">4.14.1.6</span><span class="cts_passage">“That is Gavroche,” said Enjolras. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">4.14.1.7</span><span class="cts_passage">“He is warning us,” said Combeferre. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">4.14.1.8</span><span class="cts_passage">A hasty rush troubled the deserted street; they beheld a being more agile than a clown climb over the omnibus, and Gavroche bounded into the barricade, all breathless, saying:— </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">4.14.1.9</span><span class="cts_passage">“My gun! Here they are!” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">4.14.1.10</span><span class="cts_passage">An electric quiver shot through the whole barricade, and the sound of hands seeking their guns became audible. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">4.14.1.11</span><span class="cts_passage">“Would you like my carbine?” said Enjolras to the lad. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">4.14.1.12</span><span class="cts_passage">“I want a big gun,” replied Gavroche. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">4.14.1.13</span><span class="cts_passage">And he seized Javert’s gun. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">4.14.1.14</span><span class="cts_passage">Two sentinels had fallen back, and had come in almost at the same moment as Gavroche. They were the sentinels from the end of the street, and the vidette of the Rue de la Petite-Truanderie. The vidette of the Lane des Prêcheurs had remained at his post, which indicated that nothing was approaching from the direction of the bridges and Halles. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">4.14.1.15</span><span class="cts_passage">The Rue de la Chanvrerie, of which a few paving-stones alone were dimly visible in the reflection of the light projected on the flag, offered to the insurgents the aspect of a vast black door vaguely opened into a smoke. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">4.14.1.16</span><span class="cts_passage">Each man had taken up his position for the conflict. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">4.14.1.17</span><span class="cts_passage">Forty-three insurgents, among whom were Enjolras, Combeferre, Courfeyrac, Bossuet, Joly, Bahorel, and Gavroche, were kneeling inside the large barricade, with their heads on a level with the crest of the barrier, the barrels of their guns and carbines aimed on the stones as though at loop-holes, attentive, mute, ready to fire. Six, commanded by Feuilly, had installed themselves, with their guns levelled at their shoulders, at the windows of the two stories of Corinthe. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">4.14.1.18</span><span class="cts_passage">Several minutes passed thus, then a sound of footsteps, measured, heavy, and numerous, became distinctly audible in the direction of Saint-Leu. This sound, faint at first, then precise, then heavy and sonorous, approached slowly, without halt, without intermission, with a tranquil and terrible continuity. Nothing was to be heard but this. It was that combined silence and sound, of the statue of the commander, but this stony step had something indescribably enormous and multiple about it which awakened the idea of a throng, and, at the same time, the idea of a spectre. One thought one heard the terrible statue Legion marching onward. This tread drew near; it drew still nearer, and stopped. It seemed as though the breathing of many men could be heard at the end of the street. Nothing was to be seen, however, but at the bottom of that dense obscurity there could be distinguished a multitude of metallic threads, as fine as needles and almost imperceptible, which moved about like those indescribable phosphoric networks which one sees beneath one’s closed eyelids, in the first mists of slumber at the moment when one is dropping off to sleep. These were bayonets and gun-barrels confusedly illuminated by the distant reflection of the torch. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">4.14.1.19</span><span class="cts_passage">A pause ensued, as though both sides were waiting. All at once, from the depths of this darkness, a voice, which was all the more sinister, since no one was visible, and which appeared to be the gloom itself speaking, shouted:— </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">4.14.1.20</span><span class="cts_passage">“Who goes there?” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">4.14.1.21</span><span class="cts_passage">At the same time, the click of guns, as they were lowered into position, was heard. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">4.14.1.22</span><span class="cts_passage">Enjolras replied in a haughty and vibrating tone:— </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">4.14.1.23</span><span class="cts_passage">“The French Revolution!” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">4.14.1.24</span><span class="cts_passage">“Fire!” shouted the voice. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">4.14.1.25</span><span class="cts_passage">A flash empurpled all the façades in the street as though the door of a furnace had been flung open, and hastily closed again. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">4.14.1.26</span><span class="cts_passage">A fearful detonation burst forth on the barricade. The red flag fell. The discharge had been so violent and so dense that it had cut the staff, that is to say, the very tip of the omnibus pole. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">4.14.1.27</span><span class="cts_passage">Bullets which had rebounded from the cornices of the houses penetrated the barricade and wounded several men. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">4.14.1.28</span><span class="cts_passage">The impression produced by this first discharge was freezing. The attack had been rough, and of a nature to inspire reflection in the boldest. It was evident that they had to deal with an entire regiment at the very least. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">4.14.1.29</span><span class="cts_passage">“Comrades!” shouted Courfeyrac, “let us not waste our powder. Let us wait until they are in the street before replying.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">4.14.1.30</span><span class="cts_passage">“And, above all,” said Enjolras, “let us raise the flag again.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">4.14.1.31</span><span class="cts_passage">He picked up the flag, which had fallen precisely at his feet. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">4.14.1.32</span><span class="cts_passage">Outside, the clatter of the ramrods in the guns could be heard; the troops were re-loading their arms. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">4.14.1.33</span><span class="cts_passage">Enjolras went on:— </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">4.14.1.34</span><span class="cts_passage">“Who is there here with a bold heart? Who will plant the flag on the barricade again?” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">4.14.1.35</span><span class="cts_passage">Not a man responded. To mount on the barricade at the very moment when, without any doubt, it was again the object of their aim, was simply death. The bravest hesitated to pronounce his own condemnation. Enjolras himself felt a thrill. He repeated:— </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">4.14.1.36</span><span class="cts_passage">“Does no one volunteer?” </span></div></div>
