			<div class="cts_corpus"><div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.13.head</span><span class="cts_passage">CHAPTER XIII—SOLUS CUM SOLO, IN LOCO REMOTO, NON COGITABUNTUR ORARE PATER NOSTER </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.13.1</span><span class="cts_passage">Marius, dreamer as he was, was, as we have said, firm and energetic by nature. His habits of solitary meditation, while they had developed in him sympathy and compassion, had, perhaps, diminished the faculty for irritation, but had left intact the power of waxing indignant; he had the kindliness of a brahmin, and the severity of a judge; he took pity upon a toad, but he crushed a viper. Now, it was into a hole of vipers that his glance had just been directed, it was a nest of monsters that he had beneath his eyes. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.13.2</span><span class="cts_passage">“These wretches must be stamped upon,” said he. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.13.3</span><span class="cts_passage">Not one of the enigmas which he had hoped to see solved had been elucidated; on the contrary, all of them had been rendered more dense, if anything; he knew nothing more about the beautiful maiden of the Luxembourg and the man whom he called M. Leblanc, except that Jondrette was acquainted with them. Athwart the mysterious words which had been uttered, the only thing of which he caught a distinct glimpse was the fact that an ambush was in course of preparation, a dark but terrible trap; that both of them were incurring great danger, she probably, her father certainly; that they must be saved; that the hideous plots of the Jondrettes must be thwarted, and the web of these spiders broken. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.13.4</span><span class="cts_passage">He scanned the female Jondrette for a moment. She had pulled an old sheet-iron stove from a corner, and she was rummaging among the old heap of iron. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.13.5</span><span class="cts_passage">He descended from the commode as softly as possible, taking care not to make the least noise. Amid his terror as to what was in preparation, and in the horror with which the Jondrettes had inspired him, he experienced a sort of joy at the idea that it might be granted to him perhaps to render a service to the one whom he loved. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.13.6</span><span class="cts_passage">But how was it to be done? How warn the persons threatened? He did not know their address. They had reappeared for an instant before his eyes, and had then plunged back again into the immense depths of Paris. Should he wait for M. Leblanc at the door that evening at six o’clock, at the moment of his arrival, and warn him of the trap? But Jondrette and his men would see him on the watch, the spot was lonely, they were stronger than he, they would devise means to seize him or to get him away, and the man whom Marius was anxious to save would be lost. One o’clock had just struck, the trap was to be sprung at six. Marius had five hours before him. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.13.7</span><span class="cts_passage">There was but one thing to be done. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.13.8</span><span class="cts_passage">He put on his decent coat, knotted a silk handkerchief round his neck, took his hat, and went out, without making any more noise than if he had been treading on moss with bare feet. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.13.9</span><span class="cts_passage">Moreover, the Jondrette woman continued to rummage among her old iron. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.13.10</span><span class="cts_passage">Once outside of the house, he made for the Rue du Petit-Banquier. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.13.11</span><span class="cts_passage">He had almost reached the middle of this street, near a very low wall which a man can easily step over at certain points, and which abuts on a waste space, and was walking slowly, in consequence of his preoccupied condition, and the snow deadened the sound of his steps; all at once he heard voices talking very close by. He turned his head, the street was deserted, there was not a soul in it, it was broad daylight, and yet he distinctly heard voices. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.13.12</span><span class="cts_passage">It occurred to him to glance over the wall which he was skirting. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.13.13</span><span class="cts_passage">There, in fact, sat two men, flat on the snow, with their backs against the wall, talking together in subdued tones. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.13.14</span><span class="cts_passage">These two persons were strangers to him; one was a bearded man in a blouse, and the other a long-haired individual in rags. The bearded man had on a fez, the other’s head was bare, and the snow had lodged in his hair. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.13.15</span><span class="cts_passage">By thrusting his head over the wall, Marius could hear their remarks. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.13.16</span><span class="cts_passage">The hairy one jogged the other man’s elbow and said:— </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.13.17</span><span class="cts_passage">“—With the assistance of Patron-Minette, it can’t fail.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.13.18</span><span class="cts_passage">“Do you think so?” said the bearded man. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.13.19</span><span class="cts_passage">And the long-haired one began again:— </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.13.20</span><span class="cts_passage">“It’s as good as a warrant for each one, of five hundred balls, and the worst that can happen is five years, six years, ten years at the most!” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.13.21</span><span class="cts_passage">The other replied with some hesitation, and shivering beneath his fez:— </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.13.22</span><span class="cts_passage">“That’s a real thing. You can’t go against such things.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.13.23</span><span class="cts_passage">“I tell you that the affair can’t go wrong,” resumed the long-haired man. “Father What’s-his-name’s team will be already harnessed.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.13.24</span><span class="cts_passage">Then they began to discuss a melodrama that they had seen on the preceding evening at the Gaîté Theatre. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.13.25</span><span class="cts_passage">Marius went his way. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.13.26</span><span class="cts_passage">It seemed to him that the mysterious words of these men, so strangely hidden behind that wall, and crouching in the snow, could not but bear some relation to Jondrette’s abominable projects. That must be _the affair_. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.13.27</span><span class="cts_passage">He directed his course towards the faubourg Saint-Marceau and asked at the first shop he came to where he could find a commissary of police. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.13.28</span><span class="cts_passage">He was directed to Rue de Pontoise, No. 14. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.13.29</span><span class="cts_passage">Thither Marius betook himself. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.13.30</span><span class="cts_passage">As he passed a baker’s shop, he bought a two-penny roll, and ate it, foreseeing that he should not dine. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.13.31</span><span class="cts_passage">On the way, he rendered justice to Providence. He reflected that had he not given his five francs to the Jondrette girl in the morning, he would have followed M. Leblanc’s fiacre, and consequently have remained ignorant of everything, and that there would have been no obstacle to the trap of the Jondrettes and that M. Leblanc would have been lost, and his daughter with him, no doubt. </span></div></div>
