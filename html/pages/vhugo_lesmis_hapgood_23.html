<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">1.2.5.1</span><span class="cts_passage">After bidding his sister good night, Monseigneur Bienvenu took one of the two silver candlesticks from the table, handed the other to his guest, and said to him,— </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">1.2.5.2</span><span class="cts_passage">“Monsieur, I will conduct you to your room.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">1.2.5.3</span><span class="cts_passage">The man followed him. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">1.2.5.4</span><span class="cts_passage">As might have been observed from what has been said above, the house was so arranged that in order to pass into the oratory where the alcove was situated, or to get out of it, it was necessary to traverse the Bishop’s bedroom. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">1.2.5.5</span><span class="cts_passage">At the moment when he was crossing this apartment, Madame Magloire was putting away the silverware in the cupboard near the head of the bed. This was her last care every evening before she went to bed. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">1.2.5.6</span><span class="cts_passage">The Bishop installed his guest in the alcove. A fresh white bed had been prepared there. The man set the candle down on a small table. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">1.2.5.7</span><span class="cts_passage">“Well,” said the Bishop, “may you pass a good night. To-morrow morning, before you set out, you shall drink a cup of warm milk from our cows.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">1.2.5.8</span><span class="cts_passage">“Thanks, Monsieur l’ Abbé,” said the man. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">1.2.5.9</span><span class="cts_passage">Hardly had he pronounced these words full of peace, when all of a sudden, and without transition, he made a strange movement, which would have frozen the two sainted women with horror, had they witnessed it. Even at this day it is difficult for us to explain what inspired him at that moment. Did he intend to convey a warning or to throw out a menace? Was he simply obeying a sort of instinctive impulse which was obscure even to himself? He turned abruptly to the old man, folded his arms, and bending upon his host a savage gaze, he exclaimed in a hoarse voice:— </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">1.2.5.10</span><span class="cts_passage">“Ah! really! You lodge me in your house, close to yourself like this?” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">1.2.5.11</span><span class="cts_passage">He broke off, and added with a laugh in which there lurked something monstrous:— </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">1.2.5.12</span><span class="cts_passage">“Have you really reflected well? How do you know that I have not been an assassin?” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">1.2.5.13</span><span class="cts_passage">The Bishop replied:— </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">1.2.5.14</span><span class="cts_passage">“That is the concern of the good God.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">1.2.5.15</span><span class="cts_passage">Then gravely, and moving his lips like one who is praying or talking to himself, he raised two fingers of his right hand and bestowed his benediction on the man, who did not bow, and without turning his head or looking behind him, he returned to his bedroom. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">1.2.5.16</span><span class="cts_passage">When the alcove was in use, a large serge curtain drawn from wall to wall concealed the altar. The Bishop knelt before this curtain as he passed and said a brief prayer. A moment later he was in his garden, walking, meditating, contemplating, his heart and soul wholly absorbed in those grand and mysterious things which God shows at night to the eyes which remain open. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">1.2.5.17</span><span class="cts_passage">As for the man, he was actually so fatigued that he did not even profit by the nice white sheets. Snuffing out his candle with his nostrils after the manner of convicts, he dropped, all dressed as he was, upon the bed, where he immediately fell into a profound sleep. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">1.2.5.18</span><span class="cts_passage">Midnight struck as the Bishop returned from his garden to his apartment. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">1.2.5.19</span><span class="cts_passage">A few minutes later all were asleep in the little house. </span></div></div>
