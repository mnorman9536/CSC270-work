<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.9.2.1</span><span class="cts_passage">One day, Jean Valjean descended his staircase, took three steps in the street, seated himself on a post, on that same stone post where Gavroche had found him meditating on the night between the 5th and the 6th of June; he remained there a few moments, then went upstairs again. This was the last oscillation of the pendulum. On the following day he did not leave his apartment. On the day after that, he did not leave his bed. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.9.2.2</span><span class="cts_passage">His portress, who prepared his scanty repasts, a few cabbages or potatoes with bacon, glanced at the brown earthenware plate and exclaimed: </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.9.2.3</span><span class="cts_passage">“But you ate nothing yesterday, poor, dear man!” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.9.2.4</span><span class="cts_passage">“Certainly I did,” replied Jean Valjean. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.9.2.5</span><span class="cts_passage">“The plate is quite full.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.9.2.6</span><span class="cts_passage">“Look at the water jug. It is empty.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.9.2.7</span><span class="cts_passage">“That proves that you have drunk; it does not prove that you have eaten.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.9.2.8</span><span class="cts_passage">“Well,” said Jean Valjean, “what if I felt hungry only for water?” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.9.2.9</span><span class="cts_passage">“That is called thirst, and, when one does not eat at the same time, it is called fever.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.9.2.10</span><span class="cts_passage">“I will eat to-morrow.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.9.2.11</span><span class="cts_passage">“Or at Trinity day. Why not to-day? Is it the thing to say: ‘I will eat to-morrow’? The idea of leaving my platter without even touching it! My lady-finger potatoes were so good!” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.9.2.12</span><span class="cts_passage">Jean Valjean took the old woman’s hand: </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.9.2.13</span><span class="cts_passage">“I promise you that I will eat them,” he said, in his benevolent voice. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.9.2.14</span><span class="cts_passage">“I am not pleased with you,” replied the portress. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.9.2.15</span><span class="cts_passage">Jean Valjean saw no other human creature than this good woman. There are streets in Paris through which no one ever passes, and houses to which no one ever comes. He was in one of those streets and one of those houses. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.9.2.16</span><span class="cts_passage">While he still went out, he had purchased of a coppersmith, for a few sous, a little copper crucifix which he had hung up on a nail opposite his bed. That gibbet is always good to look at. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.9.2.17</span><span class="cts_passage">A week passed, and Jean Valjean had not taken a step in his room. He still remained in bed. The portress said to her husband:—“The good man upstairs yonder does not get up, he no longer eats, he will not last long. That man has his sorrows, that he has. You won’t get it out of my head that his daughter has made a bad marriage.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.9.2.18</span><span class="cts_passage">The porter replied, with the tone of marital sovereignty: </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.9.2.19</span><span class="cts_passage">“If he’s rich, let him have a doctor. If he is not rich, let him go without. If he has no doctor he will die.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.9.2.20</span><span class="cts_passage">“And if he has one?” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.9.2.21</span><span class="cts_passage">“He will die,” said the porter. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.9.2.22</span><span class="cts_passage">The portress set to scraping away the grass from what she called her pavement, with an old knife, and, as she tore out the blades, she grumbled: </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.9.2.23</span><span class="cts_passage">“It’s a shame. Such a neat old man! He’s as white as a chicken.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.9.2.24</span><span class="cts_passage">She caught sight of the doctor of the quarter as he passed the end of the street; she took it upon herself to request him to come upstairs. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.9.2.25</span><span class="cts_passage">“It’s on the second floor,” said she. “You have only to enter. As the good man no longer stirs from his bed, the door is always unlocked.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.9.2.26</span><span class="cts_passage">The doctor saw Jean Valjean and spoke with him. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.9.2.27</span><span class="cts_passage">When he came down again the portress interrogated him: </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.9.2.28</span><span class="cts_passage">“Well, doctor?” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.9.2.29</span><span class="cts_passage">“Your sick man is very ill indeed.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.9.2.30</span><span class="cts_passage">“What is the matter with him?” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.9.2.31</span><span class="cts_passage">“Everything and nothing. He is a man who, to all appearances, has lost some person who is dear to him. People die of that.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.9.2.32</span><span class="cts_passage">“What did he say to you?” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.9.2.33</span><span class="cts_passage">“He told me that he was in good health.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.9.2.34</span><span class="cts_passage">“Shall you come again, doctor?” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.9.2.35</span><span class="cts_passage">“Yes,” replied the doctor. “But some one else besides must come.” </span></div></div>
