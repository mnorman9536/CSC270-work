<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.1.13.1</span><span class="cts_passage">In the chaos of sentiments and passions which defend a barricade, there is a little of everything; there is bravery, there is youth, honor, enthusiasm, the ideal, conviction, the rage of the gambler, and, above all, intermittences of hope. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.1.13.2</span><span class="cts_passage">One of these intermittences, one of these vague quivers of hope suddenly traversed the barricade of the Rue de la Chanvrerie at the moment when it was least expected. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.1.13.3</span><span class="cts_passage">“Listen,” suddenly cried Enjolras, who was still on the watch, “it seems to me that Paris is waking up.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.1.13.4</span><span class="cts_passage">It is certain that, on the morning of the 6th of June, the insurrection broke out afresh for an hour or two, to a certain extent. The obstinacy of the alarm peal of Saint-Merry reanimated some fancies. Barricades were begun in the Rue du Poirier and the Rue des Gravilliers. In front of the Porte Saint-Martin, a young man, armed with a rifle, attacked alone a squadron of cavalry. In plain sight, on the open boulevard, he placed one knee on the ground, shouldered his weapon, fired, killed the commander of the squadron, and turned away, saying: “There’s another who will do us no more harm.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.1.13.5</span><span class="cts_passage">He was put to the sword. In the Rue Saint-Denis, a woman fired on the National Guard from behind a lowered blind. The slats of the blind could be seen to tremble at every shot. A child fourteen years of age was arrested in the Rue de la Cossonerie, with his pockets full of cartridges. Many posts were attacked. At the entrance to the Rue Bertin-Poirée, a very lively and utterly unexpected fusillade welcomed a regiment of cuirrassiers, at whose head marched Marshal General Cavaignac de Barague. In the Rue Planche-Mibray, they threw old pieces of pottery and household utensils down on the soldiers from the roofs; a bad sign; and when this matter was reported to Marshal Soult, Napoleon’s old lieutenant grew thoughtful, as he recalled Suchet’s saying at Saragossa: “We are lost when the old women empty their pots de chambre on our heads.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.1.13.6</span><span class="cts_passage">These general symptoms which presented themselves at the moment when it was thought that the uprising had been rendered local, this fever of wrath, these sparks which flew hither and thither above those deep masses of combustibles which are called the faubourgs of Paris,—all this, taken together, disturbed the military chiefs. They made haste to stamp out these beginnings of conflagration. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.1.13.7</span><span class="cts_passage">They delayed the attack on the barricades Maubuée, de la Chanvrerie and Saint-Merry until these sparks had been extinguished, in order that they might have to deal with the barricades only and be able to finish them at one blow. Columns were thrown into the streets where there was fermentation, sweeping the large, sounding the small, right and left, now slowly and cautiously, now at full charge. The troops broke in the doors of houses whence shots had been fired; at the same time, manœuvres by the cavalry dispersed the groups on the boulevards. This repression was not effected without some commotion, and without that tumultuous uproar peculiar to collisions between the army and the people. This was what Enjolras had caught in the intervals of the cannonade and the musketry. Moreover, he had seen wounded men passing the end of the street in litters, and he said to Courfeyrac:—“Those wounded do not come from us.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.1.13.8</span><span class="cts_passage">Their hope did not last long; the gleam was quickly eclipsed. In less than half an hour, what was in the air vanished, it was a flash of lightning unaccompanied by thunder, and the insurgents felt that sort of leaden cope, which the indifference of the people casts over obstinate and deserted men, fall over them once more. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.1.13.9</span><span class="cts_passage">The general movement, which seemed to have assumed a vague outline, had miscarried; and the attention of the minister of war and the strategy of the generals could now be concentrated on the three or four barricades which still remained standing. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.1.13.10</span><span class="cts_passage">The sun was mounting above the horizon. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.1.13.11</span><span class="cts_passage">An insurgent hailed Enjolras. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.1.13.12</span><span class="cts_passage">“We are hungry here. Are we really going to die like this, without anything to eat?” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.1.13.13</span><span class="cts_passage">Enjolras, who was still leaning on his elbows at his embrasure, made an affirmative sign with his head, but without taking his eyes from the end of the street. </span></div></div>
