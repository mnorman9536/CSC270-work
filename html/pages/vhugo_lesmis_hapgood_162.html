<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">2.8.6.1</span><span class="cts_passage">Who was in the coffin? The reader knows. Jean Valjean. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">2.8.6.2</span><span class="cts_passage">Jean Valjean had arranged things so that he could exist there, and he could almost breathe. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">2.8.6.3</span><span class="cts_passage">It is a strange thing to what a degree security of conscience confers security of the rest. Every combination thought out by Jean Valjean had been progressing, and progressing favorably, since the preceding day. He, like Fauchelevent, counted on Father Mestienne. He had no doubt as to the end. Never was there a more critical situation, never more complete composure. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">2.8.6.4</span><span class="cts_passage">The four planks of the coffin breathe out a kind of terrible peace. It seemed as though something of the repose of the dead entered into Jean Valjean’s tranquillity. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">2.8.6.5</span><span class="cts_passage">From the depths of that coffin he had been able to follow, and he had followed, all the phases of the terrible drama which he was playing with death. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">2.8.6.6</span><span class="cts_passage">Shortly after Fauchelevent had finished nailing on the upper plank, Jean Valjean had felt himself carried out, then driven off. He knew, from the diminution in the jolting, when they left the pavements and reached the earth road. He had divined, from a dull noise, that they were crossing the bridge of Austerlitz. At the first halt, he had understood that they were entering the cemetery; at the second halt, he said to himself:— </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">2.8.6.7</span><span class="cts_passage">“Here is the grave.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">2.8.6.8</span><span class="cts_passage">Suddenly, he felt hands seize the coffin, then a harsh grating against the planks; he explained it to himself as the rope which was being fastened round the casket in order to lower it into the cavity. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">2.8.6.9</span><span class="cts_passage">Then he experienced a giddiness. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">2.8.6.10</span><span class="cts_passage">The undertaker’s man and the grave-digger had probably allowed the coffin to lose its balance, and had lowered the head before the foot. He recovered himself fully when he felt himself horizontal and motionless. He had just touched the bottom. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">2.8.6.11</span><span class="cts_passage">He had a certain sensation of cold. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">2.8.6.12</span><span class="cts_passage">A voice rose above him, glacial and solemn. He heard Latin words, which he did not understand, pass over him, so slowly that he was able to catch them one by one:— </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">2.8.6.13</span><span class="cts_passage">_“Qui dormiunt in terræ pulvere, evigilabunt; alii in vitam æternam, et alii in approbrium, ut videant semper.” _ </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">2.8.6.14</span><span class="cts_passage">A child’s voice said:— </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">2.8.6.15</span><span class="cts_passage">_“De profundis.” _ </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">2.8.6.16</span><span class="cts_passage">The grave voice began again:— </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">2.8.6.17</span><span class="cts_passage">_“Requiem æternam dona ei, Domine.” _ </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">2.8.6.18</span><span class="cts_passage">The child’s voice responded:— </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">2.8.6.19</span><span class="cts_passage">_“Et lux perpetua luceat ei.” _ </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">2.8.6.20</span><span class="cts_passage">He heard something like the gentle patter of several drops of rain on the plank which covered him. It was probably the holy water. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">2.8.6.21</span><span class="cts_passage">He thought: “This will be over soon now. Patience for a little while longer. The priest will take his departure. Fauchelevent will take Mestienne off to drink. I shall be left. Then Fauchelevent will return alone, and I shall get out. That will be the work of a good hour.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">2.8.6.22</span><span class="cts_passage">The grave voice resumed </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">2.8.6.23</span><span class="cts_passage">_“Requiescat in pace.” _ </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">2.8.6.24</span><span class="cts_passage">And the child’s voice said:— </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">2.8.6.25</span><span class="cts_passage">_“Amen.” _ </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">2.8.6.26</span><span class="cts_passage">Jean Valjean strained his ears, and heard something like retreating footsteps. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">2.8.6.27</span><span class="cts_passage">“There, they are going now,” thought he. “I am alone.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">2.8.6.28</span><span class="cts_passage">All at once, he heard over his head a sound which seemed to him to be a clap of thunder. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">2.8.6.29</span><span class="cts_passage">It was a shovelful of earth falling on the coffin. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">2.8.6.30</span><span class="cts_passage">A second shovelful fell. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">2.8.6.31</span><span class="cts_passage">One of the holes through which he breathed had just been stopped up. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">2.8.6.32</span><span class="cts_passage">A third shovelful of earth fell. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">2.8.6.33</span><span class="cts_passage">Then a fourth. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">2.8.6.34</span><span class="cts_passage">There are things which are too strong for the strongest man. Jean Valjean lost consciousness. </span></div></div>
