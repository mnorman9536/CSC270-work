<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">1.3.9.1</span><span class="cts_passage">When the young girls were left alone, they leaned two by two on the window-sills, chatting, craning out their heads, and talking from one window to the other. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">1.3.9.2</span><span class="cts_passage">They saw the young men emerge from the Café Bombarda arm in arm. The latter turned round, made signs to them, smiled, and disappeared in that dusty Sunday throng which makes a weekly invasion into the Champs-Élysées. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">1.3.9.3</span><span class="cts_passage">“Don’t be long!” cried Fantine. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">1.3.9.4</span><span class="cts_passage">“What are they going to bring us?” said Zéphine. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">1.3.9.5</span><span class="cts_passage">“It will certainly be something pretty,” said Dahlia. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">1.3.9.6</span><span class="cts_passage">“For my part,” said Favourite, “I want it to be of gold.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">1.3.9.7</span><span class="cts_passage">Their attention was soon distracted by the movements on the shore of the lake, which they could see through the branches of the large trees, and which diverted them greatly. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">1.3.9.8</span><span class="cts_passage">It was the hour for the departure of the mail-coaches and diligences. Nearly all the stage-coaches for the south and west passed through the Champs-Élysées. The majority followed the quay and went through the Passy Barrier. From moment to moment, some huge vehicle, painted yellow and black, heavily loaded, noisily harnessed, rendered shapeless by trunks, tarpaulins, and valises, full of heads which immediately disappeared, rushed through the crowd with all the sparks of a forge, with dust for smoke, and an air of fury, grinding the pavements, changing all the paving-stones into steels. This uproar delighted the young girls. Favourite exclaimed:— </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">1.3.9.9</span><span class="cts_passage">“What a row! One would say that it was a pile of chains flying away.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">1.3.9.10</span><span class="cts_passage">It chanced that one of these vehicles, which they could only see with difficulty through the thick elms, halted for a moment, then set out again at a gallop. This surprised Fantine. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">1.3.9.11</span><span class="cts_passage">“That’s odd!” said she. “I thought the diligence never stopped.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">1.3.9.12</span><span class="cts_passage">Favourite shrugged her shoulders. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">1.3.9.13</span><span class="cts_passage">“This Fantine is surprising. I am coming to take a look at her out of curiosity. She is dazzled by the simplest things. Suppose a case: I am a traveller; I say to the diligence, ‘I will go on in advance; you shall pick me up on the quay as you pass.’ The diligence passes, sees me, halts, and takes me. That is done every day. You do not know life, my dear.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">1.3.9.14</span><span class="cts_passage">In this manner a certain time elapsed. All at once Favourite made a movement, like a person who is just waking up. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">1.3.9.15</span><span class="cts_passage">“Well,” said she, “and the surprise?” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">1.3.9.16</span><span class="cts_passage">“Yes, by the way,” joined in Dahlia, “the famous surprise?” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">1.3.9.17</span><span class="cts_passage">“They are a very long time about it!” said Fantine. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">1.3.9.18</span><span class="cts_passage">As Fantine concluded this sigh, the waiter who had served them at dinner entered. He held in his hand something which resembled a letter. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">1.3.9.19</span><span class="cts_passage">“What is that?” demanded Favourite. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">1.3.9.20</span><span class="cts_passage">The waiter replied:— </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">1.3.9.21</span><span class="cts_passage">“It is a paper that those gentlemen left for these ladies.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">1.3.9.22</span><span class="cts_passage">“Why did you not bring it at once?” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">1.3.9.23</span><span class="cts_passage">“Because,” said the waiter, “the gentlemen ordered me not to deliver it to the ladies for an hour.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">1.3.9.24</span><span class="cts_passage">Favourite snatched the paper from the waiter’s hand. It was, in fact, a letter. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">1.3.9.25</span><span class="cts_passage">“Stop!” said she; “there is no address; but this is what is written on it—” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">1.3.9.26</span><span class="cts_passage">“THIS IS THE SURPRISE.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">1.3.9.27</span><span class="cts_passage">She tore the letter open hastily, opened it, and read [she knew how to read]:— </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">1.3.9.28</span><span class="cts_passage">“OUR BELOVED:— </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">1.3.9.29</span><span class="cts_passage">“You must know that we have parents. Parents—you do not know much about such things. They are called fathers and mothers by the civil code, which is puerile and honest. Now, these parents groan, these old folks implore us, these good men and these good women call us prodigal sons; they desire our return, and offer to kill calves for us. Being virtuous, we obey them. At the hour when you read this, five fiery horses will be bearing us to our papas and mammas. We are pulling up our stakes, as Bossuet says. We are going; we are gone. We flee in the arms of Laffitte and on the wings of Caillard. The Toulouse diligence tears us from the abyss, and the abyss is you, O our little beauties! We return to society, to duty, to respectability, at full trot, at the rate of three leagues an hour. It is necessary for the good of the country that we should be, like the rest of the world, prefects, fathers of families, rural police, and councillors of state. Venerate us. We are sacrificing ourselves. Mourn for us in haste, and replace us with speed. If this letter lacerates you, do the same by it. Adieu. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">1.3.9.30</span><span class="cts_passage">“For the space of nearly two years we have made you happy. We bear you no grudge for that. “Signed: BLACHEVELLE. FAMUEIL. LISTOLIER. FÉLIX THOLOMYÈS. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">1.3.9.31</span><span class="cts_passage">“_Postscriptum_. The dinner is paid for.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">1.3.9.32</span><span class="cts_passage">The four young women looked at each other. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">1.3.9.33</span><span class="cts_passage">Favourite was the first to break the silence. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">1.3.9.34</span><span class="cts_passage">“Well!” she exclaimed, “it’s a very pretty farce, all the same.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">1.3.9.35</span><span class="cts_passage">“It is very droll,” said Zéphine. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">1.3.9.36</span><span class="cts_passage">“That must have been Blachevelle’s idea,” resumed Favourite. “It makes me in love with him. No sooner is he gone than he is loved. This is an adventure, indeed.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">1.3.9.37</span><span class="cts_passage">“No,” said Dahlia; “it was one of Tholomyès’ ideas. That is evident. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">1.3.9.38</span><span class="cts_passage">“In that case,” retorted Favourite, “death to Blachevelle, and long live Tholomyès!” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">1.3.9.39</span><span class="cts_passage">“Long live Tholomyès!” exclaimed Dahlia and Zéphine. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">1.3.9.40</span><span class="cts_passage">And they burst out laughing. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">1.3.9.41</span><span class="cts_passage">Fantine laughed with the rest. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">1.3.9.42</span><span class="cts_passage">An hour later, when she had returned to her room, she wept. It was her first love affair, as we have said; she had given herself to this Tholomyès as to a husband, and the poor girl had a child. </span></div></div>
