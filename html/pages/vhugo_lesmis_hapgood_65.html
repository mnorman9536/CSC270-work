<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">1.7.2.1</span><span class="cts_passage">From the town-hall he betook himself to the extremity of the town, to a Fleming named Master Scaufflaer, French Scaufflaire, who let out “horses and cabriolets as desired.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">1.7.2.2</span><span class="cts_passage">In order to reach this Scaufflaire, the shortest way was to take the little-frequented street in which was situated the parsonage of the parish in which M. Madeleine resided. The curé was, it was said, a worthy, respectable, and sensible man. At the moment when M. Madeleine arrived in front of the parsonage there was but one passer-by in the street, and this person noticed this: After the mayor had passed the priest’s house he halted, stood motionless, then turned about, and retraced his steps to the door of the parsonage, which had an iron knocker. He laid his hand quickly on the knocker and lifted it; then he paused again and stopped short, as though in thought, and after the lapse of a few seconds, instead of allowing the knocker to fall abruptly, he placed it gently, and resumed his way with a sort of haste which had not been apparent previously. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">1.7.2.3</span><span class="cts_passage">M. Madeleine found Master Scaufflaire at home, engaged in stitching a harness over. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">1.7.2.4</span><span class="cts_passage">“Master Scaufflaire,” he inquired, “have you a good horse?” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">1.7.2.5</span><span class="cts_passage">“Mr. Mayor,” said the Fleming, “all my horses are good. What do you mean by a good horse?” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">1.7.2.6</span><span class="cts_passage">“I mean a horse which can travel twenty leagues in a day.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">1.7.2.7</span><span class="cts_passage">“The deuce!” said the Fleming. “Twenty leagues!” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">1.7.2.8</span><span class="cts_passage">“Yes.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">1.7.2.9</span><span class="cts_passage">“Hitched to a cabriolet?” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">1.7.2.10</span><span class="cts_passage">“Yes.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">1.7.2.11</span><span class="cts_passage">“And how long can he rest at the end of his journey?” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">1.7.2.12</span><span class="cts_passage">“He must be able to set out again on the next day if necessary.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">1.7.2.13</span><span class="cts_passage">“To traverse the same road?” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">1.7.2.14</span><span class="cts_passage">“Yes.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">1.7.2.15</span><span class="cts_passage">“The deuce! the deuce! And it is twenty leagues?” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">1.7.2.16</span><span class="cts_passage">M. Madeleine drew from his pocket the paper on which he had pencilled some figures. He showed it to the Fleming. The figures were 5, 6, 8½. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">1.7.2.17</span><span class="cts_passage">“You see,” he said, “total, nineteen and a half; as well say twenty leagues.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">1.7.2.18</span><span class="cts_passage">“Mr. Mayor,” returned the Fleming, “I have just what you want. My little white horse—you may have seen him pass occasionally; he is a small beast from Lower Boulonnais. He is full of fire. They wanted to make a saddle-horse of him at first. Bah! He reared, he kicked, he laid everybody flat on the ground. He was thought to be vicious, and no one knew what to do with him. I bought him. I harnessed him to a carriage. That is what he wanted, sir; he is as gentle as a girl; he goes like the wind. Ah! indeed he must not be mounted. It does not suit his ideas to be a saddle-horse. Every one has his ambition. ‘Draw? Yes. Carry? No.’ We must suppose that is what he said to himself.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">1.7.2.19</span><span class="cts_passage">“And he will accomplish the trip?” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">1.7.2.20</span><span class="cts_passage">“Your twenty leagues all at a full trot, and in less than eight hours. But here are the conditions.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">1.7.2.21</span><span class="cts_passage">“State them.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">1.7.2.22</span><span class="cts_passage">“In the first place, you will give him half an hour’s breathing spell midway of the road; he will eat; and some one must be by while he is eating to prevent the stable boy of the inn from stealing his oats; for I have noticed that in inns the oats are more often drunk by the stable men than eaten by the horses.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">1.7.2.23</span><span class="cts_passage">“Some one will be by.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">1.7.2.24</span><span class="cts_passage">“In the second place—is the cabriolet for Monsieur le Maire?” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">1.7.2.25</span><span class="cts_passage">“Yes.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">1.7.2.26</span><span class="cts_passage">“Does Monsieur le Maire know how to drive?” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">1.7.2.27</span><span class="cts_passage">“Yes.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">1.7.2.28</span><span class="cts_passage">“Well, Monsieur le Maire will travel alone and without baggage, in order not to overload the horse?” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">1.7.2.29</span><span class="cts_passage">“Agreed.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">1.7.2.30</span><span class="cts_passage">“But as Monsieur le Maire will have no one with him, he will be obliged to take the trouble himself of seeing that the oats are not stolen.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">1.7.2.31</span><span class="cts_passage">“That is understood.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">1.7.2.32</span><span class="cts_passage">“I am to have thirty francs a day. The days of rest to be paid for also—not a farthing less; and the beast’s food to be at Monsieur le Maire’s expense.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">1.7.2.33</span><span class="cts_passage">M. Madeleine drew three napoleons from his purse and laid them on the table. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">1.7.2.34</span><span class="cts_passage">“Here is the pay for two days in advance.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">1.7.2.35</span><span class="cts_passage">“Fourthly, for such a journey a cabriolet would be too heavy, and would fatigue the horse. Monsieur le Maire must consent to travel in a little tilbury that I own.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">1.7.2.36</span><span class="cts_passage">“I consent to that.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">1.7.2.37</span><span class="cts_passage">“It is light, but it has no cover.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">1.7.2.38</span><span class="cts_passage">“That makes no difference to me.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">1.7.2.39</span><span class="cts_passage">“Has Monsieur le Maire reflected that we are in the middle of winter?” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">1.7.2.40</span><span class="cts_passage">M. Madeleine did not reply. The Fleming resumed:— </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">1.7.2.41</span><span class="cts_passage">“That it is very cold?” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">1.7.2.42</span><span class="cts_passage">M. Madeleine preserved silence. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">1.7.2.43</span><span class="cts_passage">Master Scaufflaire continued:— </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">1.7.2.44</span><span class="cts_passage">“That it may rain?” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">1.7.2.45</span><span class="cts_passage">M. Madeleine raised his head and said:— </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">1.7.2.46</span><span class="cts_passage">“The tilbury and the horse will be in front of my door to-morrow morning at half-past four o’clock.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">1.7.2.47</span><span class="cts_passage">“Of course, Monsieur le Maire,” replied Scaufflaire; then, scratching a speck in the wood of the table with his thumb-nail, he resumed with that careless air which the Flemings understand so well how to mingle with their shrewdness:— </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">1.7.2.48</span><span class="cts_passage">“But this is what I am thinking of now: Monsieur le Maire has not told me where he is going. Where is Monsieur le Maire going?” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">1.7.2.49</span><span class="cts_passage">He had been thinking of nothing else since the beginning of the conversation, but he did not know why he had not dared to put the question. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">1.7.2.50</span><span class="cts_passage">“Are your horse’s forelegs good?” said M. Madeleine. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">1.7.2.51</span><span class="cts_passage">“Yes, Monsieur le Maire. You must hold him in a little when going down hill. Are there many descends between here and the place whither you are going?” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">1.7.2.52</span><span class="cts_passage">“Do not forget to be at my door at precisely half-past four o’clock to-morrow morning,” replied M. Madeleine; and he took his departure. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">1.7.2.53</span><span class="cts_passage">The Fleming remained “utterly stupid,” as he himself said some time afterwards. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">1.7.2.54</span><span class="cts_passage">The mayor had been gone two or three minutes when the door opened again; it was the mayor once more. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">1.7.2.55</span><span class="cts_passage">He still wore the same impassive and preoccupied air. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">1.7.2.56</span><span class="cts_passage">“Monsieur Scaufflaire,” said he, “at what sum do you estimate the value of the horse and tilbury which you are to let to me,—the one bearing the other?” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">1.7.2.57</span><span class="cts_passage">“The one dragging the other, Monsieur le Maire,” said the Fleming, with a broad smile. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">1.7.2.58</span><span class="cts_passage">“So be it. Well?” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">1.7.2.59</span><span class="cts_passage">“Does Monsieur le Maire wish to purchase them or me?” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">1.7.2.60</span><span class="cts_passage">“No; but I wish to guarantee you in any case. You shall give me back the sum at my return. At what value do you estimate your horse and cabriolet?” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">1.7.2.61</span><span class="cts_passage">“Five hundred francs, Monsieur le Maire.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">1.7.2.62</span><span class="cts_passage">“Here it is.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">1.7.2.63</span><span class="cts_passage">M. Madeleine laid a bank-bill on the table, then left the room; and this time he did not return. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">1.7.2.64</span><span class="cts_passage">Master Scaufflaire experienced a frightful regret that he had not said a thousand francs. Besides the horse and tilbury together were worth but a hundred crowns. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">1.7.2.65</span><span class="cts_passage">The Fleming called his wife, and related the affair to her. “Where the devil could Monsieur le Maire be going?” They held counsel together. “He is going to Paris,” said the wife. “I don’t believe it,” said the husband. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">1.7.2.66</span><span class="cts_passage">M. Madeleine had forgotten the paper with the figures on it, and it lay on the chimney-piece. The Fleming picked it up and studied it. “Five, six, eight and a half? That must designate the posting relays.” He turned to his wife:— </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">1.7.2.67</span><span class="cts_passage">“I have found out.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">1.7.2.68</span><span class="cts_passage">“What?” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">1.7.2.69</span><span class="cts_passage">“It is five leagues from here to Hesdin, six from Hesdin to Saint-Pol, eight and a half from Saint-Pol to Arras. He is going to Arras.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">1.7.2.70</span><span class="cts_passage">Meanwhile, M. Madeleine had returned home. He had taken the longest way to return from Master Scaufflaire’s, as though the parsonage door had been a temptation for him, and he had wished to avoid it. He ascended to his room, and there he shut himself up, which was a very simple act, since he liked to go to bed early. Nevertheless, the portress of the factory, who was, at the same time, M. Madeleine’s only servant, noticed that the latter’s light was extinguished at half-past eight, and she mentioned it to the cashier when he came home, adding:— </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">1.7.2.71</span><span class="cts_passage">“Is Monsieur le Maire ill? I thought he had a rather singular air.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">1.7.2.72</span><span class="cts_passage">This cashier occupied a room situated directly under M. Madeleine’s chamber. He paid no heed to the portress’s words, but went to bed and to sleep. Towards midnight he woke up with a start; in his sleep he had heard a noise above his head. He listened; it was a footstep pacing back and forth, as though some one were walking in the room above him. He listened more attentively, and recognized M. Madeleine’s step. This struck him as strange; usually, there was no noise in M. Madeleine’s chamber until he rose in the morning. A moment later the cashier heard a noise which resembled that of a cupboard being opened, and then shut again; then a piece of furniture was disarranged; then a pause ensued; then the step began again. The cashier sat up in bed, quite awake now, and staring; and through his window-panes he saw the reddish gleam of a lighted window reflected on the opposite wall; from the direction of the rays, it could only come from the window of M. Madeleine’s chamber. The reflection wavered, as though it came rather from a fire which had been lighted than from a candle. The shadow of the window-frame was not shown, which indicated that the window was wide open. The fact that this window was open in such cold weather was surprising. The cashier fell asleep again. An hour or two later he waked again. The same step was still passing slowly and regularly back and forth overhead. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">1.7.2.73</span><span class="cts_passage">The reflection was still visible on the wall, but now it was pale and peaceful, like the reflection of a lamp or of a candle. The window was still open. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">1.7.2.74</span><span class="cts_passage">This is what had taken place in M. Madeleine’s room. </span></div></div>
