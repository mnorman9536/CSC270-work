			<div class="cts_corpus"><div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.14.head</span><span class="cts_passage">CHAPTER XIV—IN WHICH A POLICE AGENT BESTOWS TWO FISTFULS ON A LAWYER </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.14.1</span><span class="cts_passage">On arriving at No. 14, Rue de Pontoise, he ascended to the first floor and inquired for the commissary of police. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.14.2</span><span class="cts_passage">“The commissary of police is not here,” said a clerk; “but there is an inspector who takes his place. Would you like to speak to him? Are you in haste?” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.14.3</span><span class="cts_passage">“Yes,” said Marius. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.14.4</span><span class="cts_passage">The clerk introduced him into the commissary’s office. There stood a tall man behind a grating, leaning against a stove, and holding up with both hands the tails of a vast topcoat, with three collars. His face was square, with a thin, firm mouth, thick, gray, and very ferocious whiskers, and a look that was enough to turn your pockets inside out. Of that glance it might have been well said, not that it penetrated, but that it searched. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.14.5</span><span class="cts_passage">This man’s air was not much less ferocious nor less terrible than Jondrette’s; the dog is, at times, no less terrible to meet than the wolf. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.14.6</span><span class="cts_passage">“What do you want?” he said to Marius, without adding “monsieur.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.14.7</span><span class="cts_passage">“Is this Monsieur le Commissaire de Police?” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.14.8</span><span class="cts_passage">“He is absent. I am here in his stead.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.14.9</span><span class="cts_passage">“The matter is very private.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.14.10</span><span class="cts_passage">“Then speak.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.14.11</span><span class="cts_passage">“And great haste is required.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.14.12</span><span class="cts_passage">“Then speak quick.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.14.13</span><span class="cts_passage">This calm, abrupt man was both terrifying and reassuring at one and the same time. He inspired fear and confidence. Marius related the adventure to him: That a person with whom he was not acquainted otherwise than by sight, was to be inveigled into a trap that very evening; that, as he occupied the room adjoining the den, he, Marius Pontmercy, a lawyer, had heard the whole plot through the partition; that the wretch who had planned the trap was a certain Jondrette; that there would be accomplices, probably some prowlers of the barriers, among others a certain Panchaud, alias Printanier, alias Bigrenaille; that Jondrette’s daughters were to lie in wait; that there was no way of warning the threatened man, since he did not even know his name; and that, finally, all this was to be carried out at six o’clock that evening, at the most deserted point of the Boulevard de l’Hôpital, in house No. 50-52. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.14.14</span><span class="cts_passage">At the sound of this number, the inspector raised his head, and said coldly:— </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.14.15</span><span class="cts_passage">“So it is in the room at the end of the corridor?” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.14.16</span><span class="cts_passage">“Precisely,” answered Marius, and he added: “Are you acquainted with that house?” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.14.17</span><span class="cts_passage">The inspector remained silent for a moment, then replied, as he warmed the heel of his boot at the door of the stove:— </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.14.18</span><span class="cts_passage">“Apparently.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.14.19</span><span class="cts_passage">He went on, muttering between his teeth, and not addressing Marius so much as his cravat:— </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.14.20</span><span class="cts_passage">“Patron-Minette must have had a hand in this.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.14.21</span><span class="cts_passage">This word struck Marius. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.14.22</span><span class="cts_passage">“Patron-Minette,” said he, “I did hear that word pronounced, in fact.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.14.23</span><span class="cts_passage">And he repeated to the inspector the dialogue between the long-haired man and the bearded man in the snow behind the wall of the Rue du Petit-Banquier. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.14.24</span><span class="cts_passage">The inspector muttered:— </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.14.25</span><span class="cts_passage">“The long-haired man must be Brujon, and the bearded one Demi-Liard, alias Deux-Milliards.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.14.26</span><span class="cts_passage">He had dropped his eyelids again, and became absorbed in thought. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.14.27</span><span class="cts_passage">“As for Father What’s-his-name, I think I recognize him. Here, I’ve burned my coat. They always have too much fire in these cursed stoves. Number 50-52. Former property of Gorbeau.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.14.28</span><span class="cts_passage">Then he glanced at Marius. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.14.29</span><span class="cts_passage">“You saw only that bearded and that long-haired man?” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.14.30</span><span class="cts_passage">“And Panchaud.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.14.31</span><span class="cts_passage">“You didn’t see a little imp of a dandy prowling about the premises?” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.14.32</span><span class="cts_passage">“No.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.14.33</span><span class="cts_passage">“Nor a big lump of matter, resembling an elephant in the Jardin des Plantes?” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.14.34</span><span class="cts_passage">“No.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.14.35</span><span class="cts_passage">“Nor a scamp with the air of an old red tail?” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.14.36</span><span class="cts_passage">“No.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.14.37</span><span class="cts_passage">“As for the fourth, no one sees him, not even his adjutants, clerks, and employees. It is not surprising that you did not see him.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.14.38</span><span class="cts_passage">“No. Who are all those persons?” asked Marius. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.14.39</span><span class="cts_passage">The inspector answered:— </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.14.40</span><span class="cts_passage">“Besides, this is not the time for them.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.14.41</span><span class="cts_passage">He relapsed into silence, then resumed:— </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.14.42</span><span class="cts_passage">“50-52. I know that barrack. Impossible to conceal ourselves inside it without the artists seeing us, and then they will get off simply by countermanding the vaudeville. They are so modest! An audience embarrasses them. None of that, none of that. I want to hear them sing and make them dance.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.14.43</span><span class="cts_passage">This monologue concluded, he turned to Marius, and demanded, gazing at him intently the while:— </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.14.44</span><span class="cts_passage">“Are you afraid?” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.14.45</span><span class="cts_passage">“Of what?” said Marius. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.14.46</span><span class="cts_passage">“Of these men?” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.14.47</span><span class="cts_passage">“No more than yourself!” retorted Marius rudely, who had begun to notice that this police agent had not yet said “monsieur” to him. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.14.48</span><span class="cts_passage">The inspector stared still more intently at Marius, and continued with sententious solemnity:— </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.14.49</span><span class="cts_passage">“There, you speak like a brave man, and like an honest man. Courage does not fear crime, and honesty does not fear authority.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.14.50</span><span class="cts_passage">Marius interrupted him:— </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.14.51</span><span class="cts_passage">“That is well, but what do you intend to do?” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.14.52</span><span class="cts_passage">The inspector contented himself with the remark:— </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.14.53</span><span class="cts_passage">“The lodgers have pass-keys with which to get in at night. You must have one.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.14.54</span><span class="cts_passage">“Yes,” said Marius. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.14.55</span><span class="cts_passage">“Have you it about you?” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.14.56</span><span class="cts_passage">“Yes.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.14.57</span><span class="cts_passage">“Give it to me,” said the inspector. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.14.58</span><span class="cts_passage">Marius took his key from his waistcoat pocket, handed it to the inspector and added:— </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.14.59</span><span class="cts_passage">“If you will take my advice, you will come in force.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.14.60</span><span class="cts_passage">The inspector cast on Marius such a glance as Voltaire might have bestowed on a provincial academician who had suggested a rhyme to him; with one movement he plunged his hands, which were enormous, into the two immense pockets of his top-coat, and pulled out two small steel pistols, of the sort called “knock-me-downs.” Then he presented them to Marius, saying rapidly, in a curt tone:— </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.14.61</span><span class="cts_passage">“Take these. Go home. Hide in your chamber, so that you may be supposed to have gone out. They are loaded. Each one carries two balls. You will keep watch; there is a hole in the wall, as you have informed me. These men will come. Leave them to their own devices for a time. When you think matters have reached a crisis, and that it is time to put a stop to them, fire a shot. Not too soon. The rest concerns me. A shot into the ceiling, the air, no matter where. Above all things, not too soon. Wait until they begin to put their project into execution; you are a lawyer; you know the proper point.” Marius took the pistols and put them in the side pocket of his coat. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.14.62</span><span class="cts_passage">“That makes a lump that can be seen,” said the inspector. “Put them in your trousers pocket.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.14.63</span><span class="cts_passage">Marius hid the pistols in his trousers pockets. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.14.64</span><span class="cts_passage">“Now,” pursued the inspector, “there is not a minute more to be lost by any one. What time is it? Half-past two. Seven o’clock is the hour?” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.14.65</span><span class="cts_passage">“Six o’clock,” answered Marius. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.14.66</span><span class="cts_passage">“I have plenty of time,” said the inspector, “but no more than enough. Don’t forget anything that I have said to you. Bang. A pistol shot.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.14.67</span><span class="cts_passage">“Rest easy,” said Marius. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.14.68</span><span class="cts_passage">And as Marius laid his hand on the handle of the door on his way out, the inspector called to him:— </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">3.8.14.69</span><span class="cts_passage">“By the way, if you have occasion for my services between now and then, come or send here. You will ask for Inspector Javert.” </span></div></div>
