<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">4.11.3.1</span><span class="cts_passage">The worthy hair-dresser who had chased from his shop the two little fellows to whom Gavroche had opened the paternal interior of the elephant was at that moment in his shop engaged in shaving an old soldier of the legion who had served under the Empire. They were talking. The hair-dresser had, naturally, spoken to the veteran of the riot, then of General Lamarque, and from Lamarque they had passed to the Emperor. Thence sprang up a conversation between barber and soldier which Prudhomme, had he been present, would have enriched with arabesques, and which he would have entitled: “Dialogue between the razor and the sword.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">4.11.3.2</span><span class="cts_passage">“How did the Emperor ride, sir?” said the barber. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">4.11.3.3</span><span class="cts_passage">“Badly. He did not know how to fall—so he never fell.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">4.11.3.4</span><span class="cts_passage">“Did he have fine horses? He must have had fine horses!” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">4.11.3.5</span><span class="cts_passage">“On the day when he gave me my cross, I noticed his beast. It was a racing mare, perfectly white. Her ears were very wide apart, her saddle deep, a fine head marked with a black star, a very long neck, strongly articulated knees, prominent ribs, oblique shoulders and a powerful crupper. A little more than fifteen hands in height.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">4.11.3.6</span><span class="cts_passage">“A pretty horse,” remarked the hair-dresser. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">4.11.3.7</span><span class="cts_passage">“It was His Majesty’s beast.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">4.11.3.8</span><span class="cts_passage">The hair-dresser felt, that after this observation, a short silence would be fitting, so he conformed himself to it, and then went on:— </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">4.11.3.9</span><span class="cts_passage">“The Emperor was never wounded but once, was he, sir?” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">4.11.3.10</span><span class="cts_passage">The old soldier replied with the calm and sovereign tone of a man who had been there:— </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">4.11.3.11</span><span class="cts_passage">“In the heel. At Ratisbon. I never saw him so well dressed as on that day. He was as neat as a new sou.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">4.11.3.12</span><span class="cts_passage">“And you, Mr. Veteran, you must have been often wounded?” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">4.11.3.13</span><span class="cts_passage">“I?” said the soldier, “ah! not to amount to anything. At Marengo, I received two sabre-blows on the back of my neck, a bullet in the right arm at Austerlitz, another in the left hip at Jena. At Friedland, a thrust from a bayonet, there,—at the Moskowa seven or eight lance-thrusts, no matter where, at Lutzen a splinter of a shell crushed one of my fingers. Ah! and then at Waterloo, a ball from a biscaïen in the thigh, that’s all.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">4.11.3.14</span><span class="cts_passage">“How fine that is!” exclaimed the hair-dresser, in Pindaric accents, “to die on the field of battle! On my word of honor, rather than die in bed, of an illness, slowly, a bit by bit each day, with drugs, cataplasms, syringes, medicines, I should prefer to receive a cannon-ball in my belly!” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">4.11.3.15</span><span class="cts_passage">“You’re not over fastidious,” said the soldier. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">4.11.3.16</span><span class="cts_passage">He had hardly spoken when a fearful crash shook the shop. The show-window had suddenly been fractured. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">4.11.3.17</span><span class="cts_passage">The wig-maker turned pale. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">4.11.3.18</span><span class="cts_passage">“Ah, good God!” he exclaimed, “it’s one of them!” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">4.11.3.19</span><span class="cts_passage">“What?” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">4.11.3.20</span><span class="cts_passage">“A cannon-ball.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">4.11.3.21</span><span class="cts_passage">“Here it is,” said the soldier. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">4.11.3.22</span><span class="cts_passage">And he picked up something that was rolling about the floor. It was a pebble. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">4.11.3.23</span><span class="cts_passage">The hair-dresser ran to the broken window and beheld Gavroche fleeing at the full speed, towards the Marché Saint-Jean. As he passed the hair-dresser’s shop Gavroche, who had the two brats still in his mind, had not been able to resist the impulse to say good day to him, and had flung a stone through his panes. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">4.11.3.24</span><span class="cts_passage">“You see!” shrieked the hair-dresser, who from white had turned blue, “that fellow returns and does mischief for the pure pleasure of it. What has any one done to that gamin?” </span></div></div>
