<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">1.7.7.1</span><span class="cts_passage">It was nearly eight o’clock in the evening when the cart, which we left on the road, entered the porte-cochère of the Hotel de la Poste in Arras; the man whom we have been following up to this moment alighted from it, responded with an abstracted air to the attentions of the people of the inn, sent back the extra horse, and with his own hands led the little white horse to the stable; then he opened the door of a billiard-room which was situated on the ground floor, sat down there, and leaned his elbows on a table; he had taken fourteen hours for the journey which he had counted on making in six; he did himself the justice to acknowledge that it was not his fault, but at bottom, he was not sorry. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">1.7.7.2</span><span class="cts_passage">The landlady of the hotel entered. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">1.7.7.3</span><span class="cts_passage">“Does Monsieur wish a bed? Does Monsieur require supper?” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">1.7.7.4</span><span class="cts_passage">He made a sign of the head in the negative. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">1.7.7.5</span><span class="cts_passage">“The stableman says that Monsieur’s horse is extremely fatigued.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">1.7.7.6</span><span class="cts_passage">Here he broke his silence. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">1.7.7.7</span><span class="cts_passage">“Will not the horse be in a condition to set out again to-morrow morning?” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">1.7.7.8</span><span class="cts_passage">“Oh, Monsieur! he must rest for two days at least.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">1.7.7.9</span><span class="cts_passage">He inquired:— </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">1.7.7.10</span><span class="cts_passage">“Is not the posting-station located here?” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">1.7.7.11</span><span class="cts_passage">“Yes, sir.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">1.7.7.12</span><span class="cts_passage">The hostess conducted him to the office; he showed his passport, and inquired whether there was any way of returning that same night to M. sur M. by the mail-wagon; the seat beside the post-boy chanced to be vacant; he engaged it and paid for it. “Monsieur,” said the clerk, “do not fail to be here ready to start at precisely one o’clock in the morning.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">1.7.7.13</span><span class="cts_passage">This done, he left the hotel and began to wander about the town. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">1.7.7.14</span><span class="cts_passage">He was not acquainted with Arras; the streets were dark, and he walked on at random; but he seemed bent upon not asking the way of the passers-by. He crossed the little river Crinchon, and found himself in a labyrinth of narrow alleys where he lost his way. A citizen was passing along with a lantern. After some hesitation, he decided to apply to this man, not without having first glanced behind and in front of him, as though he feared lest some one should hear the question which he was about to put. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">1.7.7.15</span><span class="cts_passage">“Monsieur,” said he, “where is the court-house, if you please.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">1.7.7.16</span><span class="cts_passage">“You do not belong in town, sir?” replied the bourgeois, who was an oldish man; “well, follow me. I happen to be going in the direction of the court-house, that is to say, in the direction of the hotel of the prefecture; for the court-house is undergoing repairs just at this moment, and the courts are holding their sittings provisionally in the prefecture.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">1.7.7.17</span><span class="cts_passage">“Is it there that the Assizes are held?” he asked. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">1.7.7.18</span><span class="cts_passage">“Certainly, sir; you see, the prefecture of to-day was the bishop’s palace before the Revolution. M. de Conzié, who was bishop in ’82, built a grand hall there. It is in this grand hall that the court is held.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">1.7.7.19</span><span class="cts_passage">On the way, the bourgeois said to him:— </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">1.7.7.20</span><span class="cts_passage">“If Monsieur desires to witness a case, it is rather late. The sittings generally close at six o’clock.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">1.7.7.21</span><span class="cts_passage">When they arrived on the grand square, however, the man pointed out to him four long windows all lighted up, in the front of a vast and gloomy building. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">1.7.7.22</span><span class="cts_passage">“Upon my word, sir, you are in luck; you have arrived in season. Do you see those four windows? That is the Court of Assizes. There is light there, so they are not through. The matter must have been greatly protracted, and they are holding an evening session. Do you take an interest in this affair? Is it a criminal case? Are you a witness?” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">1.7.7.23</span><span class="cts_passage">He replied:— </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">1.7.7.24</span><span class="cts_passage">“I have not come on any business; I only wish to speak to one of the lawyers.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">1.7.7.25</span><span class="cts_passage">“That is different,” said the bourgeois. “Stop, sir; here is the door where the sentry stands. You have only to ascend the grand staircase.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">1.7.7.26</span><span class="cts_passage">He conformed to the bourgeois’s directions, and a few minutes later he was in a hall containing many people, and where groups, intermingled with lawyers in their gowns, were whispering together here and there. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">1.7.7.27</span><span class="cts_passage">It is always a heart-breaking thing to see these congregations of men robed in black, murmuring together in low voices, on the threshold of the halls of justice. It is rare that charity and pity are the outcome of these words. Condemnations pronounced in advance are more likely to be the result. All these groups seem to the passing and thoughtful observer so many sombre hives where buzzing spirits construct in concert all sorts of dark edifices. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">1.7.7.28</span><span class="cts_passage">This spacious hall, illuminated by a single lamp, was the old hall of the episcopal palace, and served as the large hall of the palace of justice. A double-leaved door, which was closed at that moment, separated it from the large apartment where the court was sitting. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">1.7.7.29</span><span class="cts_passage">The obscurity was such that he did not fear to accost the first lawyer whom he met. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">1.7.7.30</span><span class="cts_passage">“What stage have they reached, sir?” he asked. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">1.7.7.31</span><span class="cts_passage">“It is finished,” said the lawyer. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">1.7.7.32</span><span class="cts_passage">“Finished!” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">1.7.7.33</span><span class="cts_passage">This word was repeated in such accents that the lawyer turned round. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">1.7.7.34</span><span class="cts_passage">“Excuse me sir; perhaps you are a relative?” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">1.7.7.35</span><span class="cts_passage">“No; I know no one here. Has judgment been pronounced?” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">1.7.7.36</span><span class="cts_passage">“Of course. Nothing else was possible.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">1.7.7.37</span><span class="cts_passage">“To penal servitude?” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">1.7.7.38</span><span class="cts_passage">“For life.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">1.7.7.39</span><span class="cts_passage">He continued, in a voice so weak that it was barely audible:— </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">1.7.7.40</span><span class="cts_passage">“Then his identity was established?” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">1.7.7.41</span><span class="cts_passage">“What identity?” replied the lawyer. “There was no identity to be established. The matter was very simple. The woman had murdered her child; the infanticide was proved; the jury threw out the question of premeditation, and she was condemned for life.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">1.7.7.42</span><span class="cts_passage">“So it was a woman?” said he. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">1.7.7.43</span><span class="cts_passage">“Why, certainly. The Limosin woman. Of what are you speaking?” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">1.7.7.44</span><span class="cts_passage">“Nothing. But since it is all over, how comes it that the hall is still lighted?” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">1.7.7.45</span><span class="cts_passage">“For another case, which was begun about two hours ago.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">1.7.7.46</span><span class="cts_passage">“What other case?” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">1.7.7.47</span><span class="cts_passage">“Oh! this one is a clear case also. It is about a sort of blackguard; a man arrested for a second offence; a convict who has been guilty of theft. I don’t know his name exactly. There’s a bandit’s phiz for you! I’d send him to the galleys on the strength of his face alone.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">1.7.7.48</span><span class="cts_passage">“Is there any way of getting into the court-room, sir?” said he. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">1.7.7.49</span><span class="cts_passage">“I really think that there is not. There is a great crowd. However, the hearing has been suspended. Some people have gone out, and when the hearing is resumed, you might make an effort.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">1.7.7.50</span><span class="cts_passage">“Where is the entrance?” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">1.7.7.51</span><span class="cts_passage">“Through yonder large door.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">1.7.7.52</span><span class="cts_passage">The lawyer left him. In the course of a few moments he had experienced, almost simultaneously, almost intermingled with each other, all possible emotions. The words of this indifferent spectator had, in turn, pierced his heart like needles of ice and like blades of fire. When he saw that nothing was settled, he breathed freely once more; but he could not have told whether what he felt was pain or pleasure. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">1.7.7.53</span><span class="cts_passage">He drew near to many groups and listened to what they were saying. The docket of the session was very heavy; the president had appointed for the same day two short and simple cases. They had begun with the infanticide, and now they had reached the convict, the old offender, the “return horse.” This man had stolen apples, but that did not appear to be entirely proved; what had been proved was, that he had already been in the galleys at Toulon. It was that which lent a bad aspect to his case. However, the man’s examination and the depositions of the witnesses had been completed, but the lawyer’s plea, and the speech of the public prosecutor were still to come; it could not be finished before midnight. The man would probably be condemned; the attorney-general was very clever, and never _missed_ his culprits; he was a brilliant fellow who wrote verses. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">1.7.7.54</span><span class="cts_passage">An usher stood at the door communicating with the hall of the Assizes. He inquired of this usher:— </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">1.7.7.55</span><span class="cts_passage">“Will the door be opened soon, sir?” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">1.7.7.56</span><span class="cts_passage">“It will not be opened at all,” replied the usher. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">1.7.7.57</span><span class="cts_passage">“What! It will not be opened when the hearing is resumed? Is not the hearing suspended?” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">1.7.7.58</span><span class="cts_passage">“The hearing has just been begun again,” replied the usher, “but the door will not be opened again.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">1.7.7.59</span><span class="cts_passage">“Why?” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">1.7.7.60</span><span class="cts_passage">“Because the hall is full.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">1.7.7.61</span><span class="cts_passage">“What! There is not room for one more?” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">1.7.7.62</span><span class="cts_passage">“Not another one. The door is closed. No one can enter now.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">1.7.7.63</span><span class="cts_passage">The usher added after a pause: “There are, to tell the truth, two or three extra places behind Monsieur le Président, but Monsieur le Président only admits public functionaries to them.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">1.7.7.64</span><span class="cts_passage">So saying, the usher turned his back. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">1.7.7.65</span><span class="cts_passage">He retired with bowed head, traversed the antechamber, and slowly descended the stairs, as though hesitating at every step. It is probable that he was holding counsel with himself. The violent conflict which had been going on within him since the preceding evening was not yet ended; and every moment he encountered some new phase of it. On reaching the landing-place, he leaned his back against the balusters and folded his arms. All at once he opened his coat, drew out his pocket-book, took from it a pencil, tore out a leaf, and upon that leaf he wrote rapidly, by the light of the street lantern, this line: _M. Madeleine, Mayor of M. sur M._; then he ascended the stairs once more with great strides, made his way through the crowd, walked straight up to the usher, handed him the paper, and said in an authoritative manner:— </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">1.7.7.66</span><span class="cts_passage">“Take this to Monsieur le Président.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">1.7.7.67</span><span class="cts_passage">The usher took the paper, cast a glance upon it, and obeyed. </span></div></div>
