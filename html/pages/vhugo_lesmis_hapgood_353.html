<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.1.9.1</span><span class="cts_passage">Opinions were exchanged in the barricade. The firing from the gun was about to begin again. Against that grape-shot, they could not hold out a quarter of an hour longer. It was absolutely necessary to deaden the blows. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.1.9.2</span><span class="cts_passage">Enjolras issued this command: </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.1.9.3</span><span class="cts_passage">“We must place a mattress there.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.1.9.4</span><span class="cts_passage">“We have none,” said Combeferre, “the wounded are lying on them.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.1.9.5</span><span class="cts_passage">Jean Valjean, who was seated apart on a stone post, at the corner of the tavern, with his gun between his knees, had, up to that moment, taken no part in anything that was going on. He did not appear to hear the combatants saying around him: “Here is a gun that is doing nothing.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.1.9.6</span><span class="cts_passage">At the order issued by Enjolras, he rose. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.1.9.7</span><span class="cts_passage">It will be remembered that, on the arrival of the rabble in the Rue de la Chanvrerie, an old woman, foreseeing the bullets, had placed her mattress in front of her window. This window, an attic window, was on the roof of a six-story house situated a little beyond the barricade. The mattress, placed cross-wise, supported at the bottom on two poles for drying linen, was upheld at the top by two ropes, which, at that distance, looked like two threads, and which were attached to two nails planted in the window frames. These ropes were distinctly visible, like hairs, against the sky. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.1.9.8</span><span class="cts_passage">“Can some one lend me a double-barrelled rifle?” said Jean Valjean. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.1.9.9</span><span class="cts_passage">Enjolras, who had just re-loaded his, handed it to him. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.1.9.10</span><span class="cts_passage">Jean Valjean took aim at the attic window and fired. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.1.9.11</span><span class="cts_passage">One of the mattress ropes was cut. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.1.9.12</span><span class="cts_passage">The mattress now hung by one thread only. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.1.9.13</span><span class="cts_passage">Jean Valjean fired the second charge. The second rope lashed the panes of the attic window. The mattress slipped between the two poles and fell into the street. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.1.9.14</span><span class="cts_passage">The barricade applauded. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.1.9.15</span><span class="cts_passage">All voices cried: </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.1.9.16</span><span class="cts_passage">“Here is a mattress!” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.1.9.17</span><span class="cts_passage">“Yes,” said Combeferre, “but who will go and fetch it?” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.1.9.18</span><span class="cts_passage">The mattress had, in fact, fallen outside the barricade, between besiegers and besieged. Now, the death of the sergeant of artillery having exasperated the troop, the soldiers had, for several minutes, been lying flat on their stomachs behind the line of paving-stones which they had erected, and, in order to supply the forced silence of the piece, which was quiet while its service was in course of reorganization, they had opened fire on the barricade. The insurgents did not reply to this musketry, in order to spare their ammunition. The fusillade broke against the barricade; but the street, which it filled, was terrible. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.1.9.19</span><span class="cts_passage">Jean Valjean stepped out of the cut, entered the street, traversed the storm of bullets, walked up to the mattress, hoisted it upon his back, and returned to the barricade. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.1.9.20</span><span class="cts_passage">He placed the mattress in the cut with his own hands. He fixed it there against the wall in such a manner that the artillery-men should not see it. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.1.9.21</span><span class="cts_passage">That done, they awaited the next discharge of grape-shot. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.1.9.22</span><span class="cts_passage">It was not long in coming. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.1.9.23</span><span class="cts_passage">The cannon vomited forth its package of buckshot with a roar. But there was no rebound. The effect which they had foreseen had been attained. The barricade was saved. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.1.9.24</span><span class="cts_passage">“Citizen,” said Enjolras to Jean Valjean, “the Republic thanks you.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.1.9.25</span><span class="cts_passage">Bossuet admired and laughed. He exclaimed: </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.1.9.26</span><span class="cts_passage">“It is immoral that a mattress should have so much power. Triumph of that which yields over that which strikes with lightning. But never mind, glory to the mattress which annuls a cannon!” </span></div></div>
