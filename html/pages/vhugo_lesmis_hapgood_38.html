<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">1.3.6.1</span><span class="cts_passage">Chat at table, the chat of love; it is as impossible to reproduce one as the other; the chat of love is a cloud; the chat at table is smoke. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">1.3.6.2</span><span class="cts_passage">Fameuil and Dahlia were humming. Tholomyès was drinking. Zéphine was laughing, Fantine smiling, Listolier blowing a wooden trumpet which he had purchased at Saint-Cloud. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">1.3.6.3</span><span class="cts_passage">Favourite gazed tenderly at Blachevelle and said:— </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">1.3.6.4</span><span class="cts_passage">“Blachevelle, I adore you.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">1.3.6.5</span><span class="cts_passage">This called forth a question from Blachevelle:— </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">1.3.6.6</span><span class="cts_passage">“What would you do, Favourite, if I were to cease to love you?” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">1.3.6.7</span><span class="cts_passage">“I!” cried Favourite. “Ah! Do not say that even in jest! If you were to cease to love me, I would spring after you, I would scratch you, I should rend you, I would throw you into the water, I would have you arrested.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">1.3.6.8</span><span class="cts_passage">Blachevelle smiled with the voluptuous self-conceit of a man who is tickled in his self-love. Favourite resumed:— </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">1.3.6.9</span><span class="cts_passage">“Yes, I would scream to the police! Ah! I should not restrain myself, not at all! Rabble!” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">1.3.6.10</span><span class="cts_passage">Blachevelle threw himself back in his chair, in an ecstasy, and closed both eyes proudly. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">1.3.6.11</span><span class="cts_passage">Dahlia, as she ate, said in a low voice to Favourite, amid the uproar:— </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">1.3.6.12</span><span class="cts_passage">“So you really idolize him deeply, that Blachevelle of yours?” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">1.3.6.13</span><span class="cts_passage">“I? I detest him,” replied Favourite in the same tone, seizing her fork again. “He is avaricious. I love the little fellow opposite me in my house. He is very nice, that young man; do you know him? One can see that he is an actor by profession. I love actors. As soon as he comes in, his mother says to him: ‘Ah! mon Dieu! my peace of mind is gone. There he goes with his shouting. But, my dear, you are splitting my head!’ So he goes up to rat-ridden garrets, to black holes, as high as he can mount, and there he sets to singing, declaiming, how do I know what? so that he can be heard downstairs! He earns twenty sous a day at an attorney’s by penning quibbles. He is the son of a former precentor of Saint-Jacques-du-Haut-Pas. Ah! he is very nice. He idolizes me so, that one day when he saw me making batter for some pancakes, he said to me: _‘Mamselle, make your gloves into fritters, and I will eat them.’_ It is only artists who can say such things as that. Ah! he is very nice. I am in a fair way to go out of my head over that little fellow. Never mind; I tell Blachevelle that I adore him—how I lie! Hey! How I do lie!” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">1.3.6.14</span><span class="cts_passage">Favourite paused, and then went on:— </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">1.3.6.15</span><span class="cts_passage">“I am sad, you see, Dahlia. It has done nothing but rain all summer; the wind irritates me; the wind does not abate. Blachevelle is very stingy; there are hardly any green peas in the market; one does not know what to eat. I have the spleen, as the English say, butter is so dear! and then you see it is horrible, here we are dining in a room with a bed in it, and that disgusts me with life.” </span></div></div>
