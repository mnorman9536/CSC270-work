<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.3.8.1</span><span class="cts_passage">In the midst of this prostration, a hand was laid on his shoulder, and a low voice said to him: </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.3.8.2</span><span class="cts_passage">“Half shares.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.3.8.3</span><span class="cts_passage">Some person in that gloom? Nothing so closely resembles a dream as despair. Jean Valjean thought that he was dreaming. He had heard no footsteps. Was it possible? He raised his eyes. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.3.8.4</span><span class="cts_passage">A man stood before him. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.3.8.5</span><span class="cts_passage">This man was clad in a blouse; his feet were bare; he held his shoes in his left hand; he had evidently removed them in order to reach Jean Valjean, without allowing his steps to be heard. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.3.8.6</span><span class="cts_passage">Jean Valjean did not hesitate for an instant. Unexpected as was this encounter, this man was known to him. The man was Thénardier. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.3.8.7</span><span class="cts_passage">Although awakened, so to speak, with a start, Jean Valjean, accustomed to alarms, and steeled to unforeseen shocks that must be promptly parried, instantly regained possession of his presence of mind. Moreover, the situation could not be made worse, a certain degree of distress is no longer capable of a crescendo, and Thénardier himself could add nothing to this blackness of this night. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.3.8.8</span><span class="cts_passage">A momentary pause ensued. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.3.8.9</span><span class="cts_passage">Thénardier, raising his right hand to a level with his forehead, formed with it a shade, then he brought his eyelashes together, by screwing up his eyes, a motion which, in connection with a slight contraction of the mouth, characterizes the sagacious attention of a man who is endeavoring to recognize another man. He did not succeed. Jean Valjean, as we have just stated, had his back turned to the light, and he was, moreover, so disfigured, so bemired, so bleeding that he would have been unrecognizable in full noonday. On the contrary, illuminated by the light from the grating, a cellar light, it is true, livid, yet precise in its lividness, Thénardier, as the energetic popular metaphor expresses it, immediately “leaped into” Jean Valjean’s eyes. This inequality of conditions sufficed to assure some advantage to Jean Valjean in that mysterious duel which was on the point of beginning between the two situations and the two men. The encounter took place between Jean Valjean veiled and Thénardier unmasked. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.3.8.10</span><span class="cts_passage">Jean Valjean immediately perceived that Thénardier did not recognize him. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.3.8.11</span><span class="cts_passage">They surveyed each other for a moment in that half-gloom, as though taking each other’s measure. Thénardier was the first to break the silence. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.3.8.12</span><span class="cts_passage">“How are you going to manage to get out?” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.3.8.13</span><span class="cts_passage">Jean Valjean made no reply. Thénardier continued: </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.3.8.14</span><span class="cts_passage">“It’s impossible to pick the lock of that gate. But still you must get out of this.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.3.8.15</span><span class="cts_passage">“That is true,” said Jean Valjean. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.3.8.16</span><span class="cts_passage">“Well, half shares then.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.3.8.17</span><span class="cts_passage">“What do you mean by that?” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.3.8.18</span><span class="cts_passage">“You have killed that man; that’s all right. I have the key.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.3.8.19</span><span class="cts_passage">Thénardier pointed to Marius. He went on: </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.3.8.20</span><span class="cts_passage">“I don’t know you, but I want to help you. You must be a friend.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.3.8.21</span><span class="cts_passage">Jean Valjean began to comprehend. Thénardier took him for an assassin. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.3.8.22</span><span class="cts_passage">Thénardier resumed: </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.3.8.23</span><span class="cts_passage">“Listen, comrade. You didn’t kill that man without looking to see what he had in his pockets. Give me my half. I’ll open the door for you.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.3.8.24</span><span class="cts_passage">And half drawing from beneath his tattered blouse a huge key, he added: </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.3.8.25</span><span class="cts_passage">“Do you want to see how a key to liberty is made? Look here.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.3.8.26</span><span class="cts_passage">Jean Valjean “remained stupid”—the expression belongs to the elder Corneille—to such a degree that he doubted whether what he beheld was real. It was Providence appearing in horrible guise, and his good angel springing from the earth in the form of Thénardier. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.3.8.27</span><span class="cts_passage">Thénardier thrust his fist into a large pocket concealed under his blouse, drew out a rope and offered it to Jean Valjean. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.3.8.28</span><span class="cts_passage">“Hold on,” said he, “I’ll give you the rope to boot.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.3.8.29</span><span class="cts_passage">“What is the rope for?” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.3.8.30</span><span class="cts_passage">“You will need a stone also, but you can find one outside. There’s a heap of rubbish.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.3.8.31</span><span class="cts_passage">“What am I to do with a stone?” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.3.8.32</span><span class="cts_passage">“Idiot, you’ll want to sling that stiff into the river, you’ll need a stone and a rope, otherwise it would float on the water.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.3.8.33</span><span class="cts_passage">Jean Valjean took the rope. There is no one who does not occasionally accept in this mechanical way. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.3.8.34</span><span class="cts_passage">Thénardier snapped his fingers as though an idea had suddenly occurred to him. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.3.8.35</span><span class="cts_passage">“Ah, see here, comrade, how did you contrive to get out of that slough yonder? I haven’t dared to risk myself in it. Phew! you don’t smell good.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.3.8.36</span><span class="cts_passage">After a pause he added: </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.3.8.37</span><span class="cts_passage">“I’m asking you questions, but you’re perfectly right not to answer. It’s an apprenticeship against that cursed quarter of an hour before the examining magistrate. And then, when you don’t talk at all, you run no risk of talking too loud. That’s no matter, as I can’t see your face and as I don’t know your name, you are wrong in supposing that I don’t know who you are and what you want. I twig. You’ve broken up that gentleman a bit; now you want to tuck him away somewhere. The river, that great hider of folly, is what you want. I’ll get you out of your scrape. Helping a good fellow in a pinch is what suits me to a hair.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.3.8.38</span><span class="cts_passage">While expressing his approval of Jean Valjean’s silence, he endeavored to force him to talk. He jostled his shoulder in an attempt to catch a sight of his profile, and he exclaimed, without, however, raising his tone: </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.3.8.39</span><span class="cts_passage">“Apropos of that quagmire, you’re a hearty animal. Why didn’t you toss the man in there?” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.3.8.40</span><span class="cts_passage">Jean Valjean preserved silence. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.3.8.41</span><span class="cts_passage">Thénardier resumed, pushing the rag which served him as a cravat to the level of his Adam’s apple, a gesture which completes the capable air of a serious man: </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.3.8.42</span><span class="cts_passage">“After all, you acted wisely. The workmen, when they come to-morrow to stop up that hole, would certainly have found the stiff abandoned there, and it might have been possible, thread by thread, straw by straw, to pick up the scent and reach you. Some one has passed through the sewer. Who? Where did he get out? Was he seen to come out? The police are full of cleverness. The sewer is treacherous and tells tales of you. Such a find is a rarity, it attracts attention, very few people make use of the sewers for their affairs, while the river belongs to everybody. The river is the true grave. At the end of a month they fish up your man in the nets at Saint-Cloud. Well, what does one care for that? It’s carrion! Who killed that man? Paris. And justice makes no inquiries. You have done well.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.3.8.43</span><span class="cts_passage">The more loquacious Thénardier became, the more mute was Jean Valjean. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.3.8.44</span><span class="cts_passage">Again Thénardier shook him by the shoulder. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.3.8.45</span><span class="cts_passage">“Now let’s settle this business. Let’s go shares. You have seen my key, show me your money.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.3.8.46</span><span class="cts_passage">Thénardier was haggard, fierce, suspicious, rather menacing, yet amicable. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.3.8.47</span><span class="cts_passage">There was one singular circumstance; Thénardier’s manners were not simple; he had not the air of being wholly at his ease; while affecting an air of mystery, he spoke low; from time to time he laid his finger on his mouth, and muttered, “hush!” It was difficult to divine why. There was no one there except themselves. Jean Valjean thought that other ruffians might possibly be concealed in some nook, not very far off, and that Thénardier did not care to share with them. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.3.8.48</span><span class="cts_passage">Thénardier resumed: </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.3.8.49</span><span class="cts_passage">“Let’s settle up. How much did the stiff have in his bags?” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.3.8.50</span><span class="cts_passage">Jean Valjean searched his pockets. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.3.8.51</span><span class="cts_passage">It was his habit, as the reader will remember, to always have some money about him. The mournful life of expedients to which he had been condemned imposed this as a law upon him. On this occasion, however, he had been caught unprepared. When donning his uniform of a National Guardsman on the preceding evening, he had forgotten, dolefully absorbed as he was, to take his pocket-book. He had only some small change in his fob. He turned out his pocket, all soaked with ooze, and spread out on the banquette of the vault one louis d’or, two five-franc pieces, and five or six large sous. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.3.8.52</span><span class="cts_passage">Thénardier thrust out his lower lip with a significant twist of the neck. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.3.8.53</span><span class="cts_passage">“You knocked him over cheap,” said he. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.3.8.54</span><span class="cts_passage">He set to feeling the pockets of Jean Valjean and Marius, with the greatest familiarity. Jean Valjean, who was chiefly concerned in keeping his back to the light, let him have his way. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.3.8.55</span><span class="cts_passage">While handling Marius’ coat, Thénardier, with the skill of a pickpocket, and without being noticed by Jean Valjean, tore off a strip which he concealed under his blouse, probably thinking that this morsel of stuff might serve, later on, to identify the assassinated man and the assassin. However, he found no more than the thirty francs. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.3.8.56</span><span class="cts_passage">“That’s true,” said he, “both of you together have no more than that.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.3.8.57</span><span class="cts_passage">And, forgetting his motto: “half shares,” he took all. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.3.8.58</span><span class="cts_passage">He hesitated a little over the large sous. After due reflection, he took them also, muttering: </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.3.8.59</span><span class="cts_passage">“Never mind! You cut folks’ throats too cheap altogether.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.3.8.60</span><span class="cts_passage">That done, he once more drew the big key from under his blouse. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.3.8.61</span><span class="cts_passage">“Now, my friend, you must leave. It’s like the fair here, you pay when you go out. You have paid, now clear out.” </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.3.8.62</span><span class="cts_passage">And he began to laugh. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.3.8.63</span><span class="cts_passage">Had he, in lending to this stranger the aid of his key, and in making some other man than himself emerge from that portal, the pure and disinterested intention of rescuing an assassin? We may be permitted to doubt this. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.3.8.64</span><span class="cts_passage">Thénardier helped Jean Valjean to replace Marius on his shoulders, then he betook himself to the grating on tiptoe, and barefooted, making Jean Valjean a sign to follow him, looked out, laid his finger on his mouth, and remained for several seconds, as though in suspense; his inspection finished, he placed the key in the lock. The bolt slipped back and the gate swung open. It neither grated nor squeaked. It moved very softly. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.3.8.65</span><span class="cts_passage">It was obvious that this gate and those hinges, carefully oiled, were in the habit of opening more frequently than was supposed. This softness was suspicious; it hinted at furtive goings and comings, silent entrances and exits of nocturnal men, and the wolf-like tread of crime. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.3.8.66</span><span class="cts_passage">The sewer was evidently an accomplice of some mysterious band. This taciturn grating was a receiver of stolen goods. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.3.8.67</span><span class="cts_passage">Thénardier opened the gate a little way, allowing just sufficient space for Jean Valjean to pass out, closed the grating again, gave the key a double turn in the lock and plunged back into the darkness, without making any more noise than a breath. He seemed to walk with the velvet paws of a tiger. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.3.8.68</span><span class="cts_passage">A moment later, that hideous providence had retreated into the invisibility. </span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">5.3.8.69</span><span class="cts_passage">Jean Valjean found himself in the open air. </span></div></div>
